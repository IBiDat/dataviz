## Introduction

The visualisation shown below by the [resourcetrade.earth](https://resourcetrade.earth) initiative explores global trade flows in 2022.

![Original visualization from resourcetrade.earth](Original_plot.png){.external width="100%"}

It shows the biggest bilateral trade trade flows in 2022, i.e., trade between 
two different countries. The thickness of the curved trade flows represents trade
volume, while the gradient color scheme, the arrows and the thickness along the 
flow describe the directionality of trade. For instance, 
the flows start very thin at the exporting country and get progressively thicker
until they reach the importing country. The trade is in commodities, ranging from
fertilizers, oilseeds or live animals to natural gas, iron and steel or pearls. 
The raw data is from the UN Comtrade data set and then re-organised and cleaned 
by the team at [resourcetrade.earth](https://resourcetrade.earth). 
The actual visualisation was made by the design agency [applied.works](https://applied.works/).

The rest of this blog post is divided in two steps. First, we will replicate the
visualisation. Then, we will produce alternative visualisations that aim to 
address some of the original plot's shortcomings.


## Replication

The replication process is divided in three separate steps: 

1. Preliminaries 

2. Country labels and annotations

3. Trade flows

### 1. Preliminaries
#### Libraries

We will use the following libraries for the replication.

```{r}
# core packages
library(tidyverse)  # includes ggplot2, dplyr, etc.
library(here)       # for file handling

# map data
library(maps)       # for map_data("world")

# labels
library(ggrepel)

# import data
library(readxl)

# font handling
library(showtext)   # for custom fonts
library(sysfonts)   # for font_add_google
```


#### Get the data

The data is provided by [resourcetrade.earth](https://resourcetrade.earth). We simply
need to click on the Download button in the right-bottom of the plot to download
an Excel file.

```{r}
data_raw <- read_excel(
  here("projects", "2024", "100540594", 
       "resourcetradeearth-all-all-all-2022.xlsx"),
  sheet = "Trades")
```

#### Clean the data

The initial dataset is extensive, containing almost 5 million observations with 
many variables that are not needed for our visualization. Thus, we will clean 
this dataset in two steps:

1. Filter for only 2022 trade data, as this matches the time period shown in the
   original visualization
2. Select five essential variables: the ISO3 code and name for both exporting 
   and importing countries, and the trade volume for each country pair or flow

```{r}
data <- data_raw |> 
  # filter for only 2022 trade data
  filter(Year == 2022) |> 
  # select essential variables: info about exporter, importer and trade volume
  select(`Exporter ISO3`, Exporter, 
         `Importer ISO3`, Importer,
         `Value (1000USD)`) |>
  # finally, rename for easier handling later
  rename(
    Exporter_ISO3 = `Exporter ISO3`,
    Importer_ISO3 = `Importer ISO3`,
    Value = `Value (1000USD)`)
```

At this stage, our data is disaggregated by resource types (such as forestry 
products, fossil fuels, and metals). This means that for each country pair, we 
have multiple rows representing different types of traded resources. However, 
the original visualization shows total trade flows between countries, summed 
across all resource types. Therefore, we need to aggregate the data by summing 
up all trade volumes for each country pair.

```{r}
# aggregate trade by country pairs
data_2 <- data |> 
  group_by(Exporter_ISO3, Exporter, Importer_ISO3, Importer) |> 
  summarize(Total_Value = sum(Value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
```

Looking at the original visualization, we can see a note in the bottom-right 
corner, indicating that it displays the 76 largest trade flows. To match 
this, we will filter our dataset to keep only the 76 largest trade flows.

```{r}
# filter for the 76 largest trade flows
data_2_filtered <- data_2 |> 
  slice_max(order_by = Total_Value, n = 76)
```

We also need to standardise some country names to make sure that the trade data 
and the map data use the same names. 

```{r}
# create mapping for country name standardisation
country_name_mapping <- data.frame(
  original = c(
    "United States", "United Arab Emirates", "Korea, Republic",
    "Russian Federation", "China, Hong Kong SAR", "Areas, nes",
    "Rest of America, nes", "United Kingdom"),
  mapped = c(
    "USA", "UAE", "South Korea", "Russia", "Hong Kong",
    "Areas, nes", "Rest of America, nes", "UK"))

# apply the standardised names to both exporters and importers
data_2_filtered <- data_2_filtered |> 
  # first standardise exporter names
  left_join(country_name_mapping, by = c("Exporter" = "original")) |> 
  mutate(Exporter = ifelse(!is.na(mapped), mapped, Exporter)) |> 
  select(-mapped) |> 
  # now standardise importer names
  left_join(country_name_mapping, by = c("Importer" = "original")) |> 
  mutate(Importer = ifelse(!is.na(mapped), mapped, Importer)) |> 
  select(-mapped)
```


#### Map Processing

Before we create our world map, we need to establish base coordinates that we
will use both for positioning country labels and for drawing the trade flows 
between countries. We will start by creating an 'empty' base world map 
in three steps:

1. Simplify the world map by removing small islands and regions that are not
   in the original plot
2. Create the two buffer zones to give the map depth
3. Apply the correct color scheme using precise hex codes

We used [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net), which provides precise 
longitude and latitude data for geographic locations. Moreover, we used 
[imagecolorpicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com) to get the hex color 
codes of the land and sea masses and the two buffer zones. 

```{r}
world_map <- map_data("world") |> 
  # filter many of the small islands
  filter(!(region %in% c(
    "French Southern and Antarctic Lands",
    "Micronesia", "Marshall Islands", "Kiribati",
    "Tuvalu", "American Samoa", "Solomon Islands",
    "Vanuatu", "New Caledonia", "Fiji", "Samoa",
    "Tonga", "Cook Islands", "Wallis and Futuna",
    "Niue", "Tokelau", "French Polynesia",
    "Pitcairn Islands", "Comoros", "Mauritius", "Seychelles",
    "Maldives", "Cape Verde", "Sao Tome and Principe",
    "Saint Helena", "Palau", "Northern Mariana Islands",
    "Nauru", "Christmas Island", "Cocos Islands",
    "Norfolk Island"))) |>
  # filter out all Pacific islands except for Australia
  filter(!(long > 140 & lat < 30 & lat > -30) | region == "Australia") |> 
  # filter out Antarctica
  filter(lat > -60)
```

The original visualization has distinctive layers. These layers create some 
'depth effect'. The land masses are bordered by a small dark grey buffer zone. 
And this buffer zone is bordered by another slightly larger light grey buffer 
zone. In the following, we will create these buffers or layers. I estimate that
the large buffer is about three times larger than the small buffer.

```{r}
# small buffer - closest to the actual landmass
buffer_small <- world_map |> 
  group_by(group) |> 
  mutate(
    long = long + sign(long - mean(long)) * 1.25,
    lat = lat + sign(lat - mean(lat)) * 1.25) 

# large buffer - creates the outermost layer
buffer_large <- world_map |> 
  group_by(group) |> 
  mutate(
    long = long + sign(long - mean(long)) * 3.75,
    lat = lat + sign(lat - mean(lat)) * 3.75)
```

We will use the "Gudea" font which comes closest to the font used in the 
original plot. We used [myfonts.com](https://www.myfonts.com/pages/whatthefont) to detect the font.

Now we can plot the world map.

```{r}
# get the font right
sysfonts::font_add_google("Gudea", family = "gudea") 
showtext::showtext_auto()

# create the basic world map with layers
p <- ggplot() +
  # sea layer (furthest)
  geom_polygon(
    data = buffer_large, 
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
    fill = "#ffffff",
    alpha = 0.15,
    color = NA) +
  # second transition layer
  geom_polygon(
    data = buffer_large, 
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
    fill = "#f9f9f9", 
    color = NA) +
  # first transition layer
  geom_polygon(
    data = buffer_small, 
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
    fill = "#eff0f0", 
    color = NA) +
  # land layer (topmost)
  geom_polygon(
    data = world_map, 
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),
    fill = "#ffffff",
    alpha = 0.95,
    color = "#b8c6c7",
    size = 0.1) +
  # set the coordinate system and aspect ratio
  coord_fixed(1.3) +
  # remove axes and grid
  theme_void() +
  # customize the theme
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#ffffff"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#ffffff"))

# display the base map
print(p)
```

### 2. Country labels and annotations

#### Positioning of country labels

First, we need to get the country names right. To this end, we create a mapping
*from* the semi-official country names *to* the names used in the visualisation.
Note that this mapping defines how the country names eventually appear on the
map, whereas the standardisation in country_name_mapping was about matching the
names in the trade dataset with the names used in the map data.

```{r}
country_labels <- data.frame(
  Country = c(
    # all the countries in the plot
    "Belgium", "Netherlands", "Germany", "France", "Italy", 
    "Switzerland", "Austria", "Spain", "UK",
    "USA", "Canada", "Mexico", "Brazil", "Peru", "Chile", "Norway",
    "Russia", "China", "Japan", "South Korea", "India", "Australia",
    "Indonesia", "Malaysia", "Thailand", "Hong Kong",
    "UAE", "Saudi Arabia", "Kuwait", "Qatar", "Oman", "Iraq", "Azerbaijan",
    "Turkey", "Algeria", "Angola", "South Africa"),
  # the actual labels of all the countries in the plot
  Label = c(
    "Bel", "Nld", "Germany", "Fra", "Italy", "Swi", "Austria", "Spain", "UK",
    "United States", "Canada", "Mexico", "Brazil", "Peru", "Chile", "Norway",
    "Russia", "China", "Japan", "Korea, \nRep.", "India", "Australia",
    "Indonesia", "Malaysia", "Thailand", "Hong Kong",
    "UAE", "Saudi \nArabia", "Kuwait", "Qatar", "Oman", "Iraq", "Azerbaijan",
    "Turkey", "Algeria", "Angola", "South Africa"))
```

We also need to add coordinates for the two special areas: 
"Rest of America, nes" and "Areas, nes". Here, "nes" stands for "not elsewhere 
specified" and refers to unknown trading partners. This can occur when reporting
countries do not submit details about the trading partner, either due to low-
value trade or to protect company information. "Rest of America, nes" represents 
unspecified trading partners specifically within the Americas. We need to do 
this manually:

```{r}
special_areas_coords <- data.frame(
  Country = c("Areas, nes", "Rest of America, nes"),
  long = c(4.46, -111.861620),
  lat = c(-50.49, 1.691649))
```

One of the key challenges in replicating this visualization is the precise 
positioning of country labels. The country labels are also the start and end 
points of the trade flows. Thus, we really do need to get the labels' positions 
right to match the original plot.

The positions of the country labels are not in the dataset. But we can 
automatically determine the positions by calculating the centroid of each 
country and placing it at this point.

```{r cache=TRUE}
# calculate basic country centroids
country_coords <- world_map |> 
  group_by(region) |> 
  summarize(
    long = mean(long),
    lat = mean(lat)) |>  
  rename(Country = region)

# combine the country_coords with the special_areas_coords
all_coords <- country_coords |> 
  bind_rows(special_areas_coords)

# prepare the trade flow data by adding start and end coordinates for each flow
# we do this here since we have just created our complete coordinate system and
# we will need this data structure for both label positioning and trade flow
# visualisation later
data_2_filtered_with_coords <- data_2_filtered |> 
  left_join(all_coords, by = c("Exporter" = "Country")) |> 
  rename(Export_Long = long, Export_Lat = lat) |> 
  left_join(all_coords, by = c("Importer" = "Country")) |> 
  rename(Import_Long = long, Import_Lat = lat)
```

Now we can create a plot with the labels positioned at the countries' centroids.

```{r}
p + 
  geom_text(
    data = country_labels %>% left_join(all_coords, by = "Country"),
    aes(x = long, y = lat, label = Label),
    size = 3)
```

The positions of the country labels do not match the positions in the original 
plot. For instance, the label "United States" is located at the North-West of 
the US. This is because of Alaska shifting the centroid in this direction. 
Additionally, the labels in Europe and the Middle East are too cluttered. 
We can try `geom_text_repel()` from the ggrepel package which automatically 
adjusts label positions to avoid overlaps while trying to keep labels close to 
their associated points.

```{r}
p + 
  geom_text_repel(
    data = country_labels %>% left_join(all_coords, by = "Country"),
    aes(x = long, y = lat, label = Label),
    size = 3,
    max.overlaps = Inf)
```

While `geom_text_repel()` solves the issue of cluttered labels in Europe and the 
Middle East, the positions of the labels still do not match the ones in the 
original plot. 

Note that an approach using the capital cities as reference points for the 
country labels does not work either. We have no alternative but to place the 
country labels manually, again using a longitude and latitude finder in the web.

```{r}
# custom coordinates of country labels
label_adjustments <- data.frame(
  Country = c(
    # South America
    "Peru", "Brazil", "Chile",
    # North America
    "USA", "Canada", "Mexico",
    # Asia
    "Russia", "India", "Indonesia", "Malaysia", "Thailand", "China", "Japan", 
    "South Korea", "Oman", "UAE", "Qatar", "Saudi Arabia", "Kuwait", "Iraq",
    "Hong Kong",
    # Europe
    "Norway", "Turkey", "Azerbaijan", "Spain", "France", "Italy", "UK",
    "Belgium", "Germany", "Switzerland", "Netherlands", "Austria",
    # Africa
    "South Africa", "Angola", "Algeria",
    # Australia
    "Australia"),
  
  long = c(
    # South America
    -75.951872, -56.385277, -70.830462,
    # North America
    -99.308645, -95.202345, -101.812930,
    # Asia
    71.909173, 77.324934, 119.847050, 112.765282, 101.445301, 102.411087, 
    139.182451, 127.749200, 58.621072, 57.301851, 55.324885, 37.991606, 
    44.178739, 40.544111, 115.203854,
    # Europe

    0.450087, 18.697300, 7.885837, 1.838480, 19.122010,
    # Africa
    25.354109, 18.169549, 2.914381,
    # Australia
    133.363988),
  
  lat = c(
    # South America
    -10.772603, -10.569497, -30.133251,
    # North America

    37.660866, 15.703697, 21.612749, 26.063568, 21.687738, 29.666373, 33.928121,
    21.943046,
    # Europe
    61.160132, 39.118608, 40.019727, 39.139647, 43.635898, 39.739402, 55.073748,
    48.931973, 52.130221, 47.172791, 56.207238, 44.663403,
    # Africa
    -29.271098, -13.306108, 27.232120,
    # Australia
    -24.820393))

# apply the adjustments to our labels
country_labels_adj <- country_labels %>%
  left_join(label_adjustments, by = "Country")
```

```{r}
# Add adjusted labels to our map
p +
  geom_text(
    data = country_labels_adj,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, label = Label),
        size = 1.65, fontface = "bold")
```

Now, the positions of the country labels match the ones in the original plot 
quite well.

#### Refinement of labels

While the country labels are now correctly positioned, we still need to do fine-
tuning to match the original plot's labels. The original plot has some text 
halo effect. This does not only look nice but also ensures better readability 
when labels overlap with trade flows. We recreate this halo effect as follows:

   - Place multiple white labels behind each text label (which is black)
   - Use slightly larger white text (size 1.75-1.77) than black text 
     (size 1.65) to create a solid white outline

In this step, we will also add the two "nes" areas.
   
```{r}
p <- p + 
  geom_text(data = country_labels_adj,
            aes(x = long - 0.1, y = lat, label = Label),
            size = 1.75,  
            color = "white",
            fontface = "bold",
            # we need to adjust the lineheight argument for "Korea, \nRep." and 
            # "Saudi \n Arabia" to make sure that the vertical spacing is fine
            lineheight = .9) +
  geom_text(data = country_labels_adj,
            aes(x = long + 0.1, y = lat, label = Label),
            size = 1.75,  
            color = "white",
            fontface = "bold",
            lineheight = .9) +
  geom_text(data = country_labels_adj,
            aes(x = long, y = lat - 0.1, label = Label),
            size = 1.75,  
            color = "white",
            fontface = "bold",
            lineheight = .9) +
  geom_text(data = country_labels_adj,
            aes(x = long, y = lat + 0.1, label = Label),
            size = 1.75,  
            color = "white",
            fontface = "bold",
            lineheight = .9) +
  
  # add country labels (white)
  geom_text(data = country_labels_adj,
            aes(x = long, y = lat, label = Label),
            size = 1.77,  # slightly larger than the black text
            color = "white",
            fontface = "bold",
            lineheight = .9) +
  
  # add country labels (black)
  geom_text(data = country_labels_adj,
            aes(x = long, y = lat, label = Label),
            size = 1.65,  
            color = "black",
            fontface = "bold",
            lineheight = .9) + 
  
  # add rectangles for nes areas
  geom_rect(data = data.frame(
    xmin = c(special_areas_coords[1,2] - 11.75, 
             special_areas_coords[2,2] - 22.5),
    xmax = c(special_areas_coords[1,2]  + 11.75, 
             special_areas_coords[2,2] + 22.5),
    ymin = c(special_areas_coords[1,3] - 2.6, 
             special_areas_coords[2,3] - 2.6),
    ymax = c(special_areas_coords[1,3] + 2.6, 
             special_areas_coords[2,3] + 2.6),
    label = c("Areas, nes", "Rest of America, nes")),
    aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax),
    fill = "#ffffff",
    alpha = .9,
    color = "#cccccc", 
    size = 0.3) +
  
  # add text labels for nes areas
  geom_text(data = data.frame(
    x = c(special_areas_coords[1,2], special_areas_coords[2,2]),
    y = c(special_areas_coords[1,3], special_areas_coords[2,3]),
    label = c("Areas, nes", "Rest of America, nes")),
    aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),
    size = 1.65, 
    fontface = "bold")  + 
  
  theme(text = element_text(family = "gudea"))

print(p)
```

#### Annotations

Finally, we can add the legend 'Scale' in the bottom-left. This legend helps 
reader understand the trade flows more easily by showing how the thickness of 
the flows corresponds to trade volume. We leave out the other annotations 
as these do not add anything meaningful to the plot. 

```{r}
p <- p + 
  annotation_custom(
    grid::rasterGrob(
      png::readPNG(here("_projects", "2024", "100540594", "legend.png")),
      x = unit(0.15, "npc"),
      y = unit(0.15, "npc"),
      width = unit(0.1, "npc")))

print(p)
```


### 3. Trade flows

The most complex part of this visualization is the trade flows. In the original
plot the trade flows have a unique leftward curvature. They start from the 
exporting country and curve left before turning right at about halfway to the
importing country. Moreover, the flows get progressively larger: the flows are 
very thin at their starting point (the exporting country) and get larger as they 
reach the importing country. Additionally, the colour of the flows changes as 
they progress. Finally, the flows have an arrow which shows the 
directionality of trade. 

#### Prepare trade flow coordinates

Before we can create the trade flows, we need to ensure we have the correct 
coordinates for both the start (exporter) and end (importer) of each flow. 
These coordinates should match the positions of our manually adjusted country 
labels rather than the geographical centroids we initially calculated.

```{r}
# merge our manual label positions with the trade flow data
data_2_filtered_with_coords <- data_2_filtered |> 
  # join with label_adjustments for exporter coordinates
  left_join(label_adjustments, by = c("Exporter" = "Country")) |> 
  rename(Export_Long = long, Export_Lat = lat) |> 
  # join again with label_adjustments for importer coordinates
  left_join(label_adjustments, by = c("Importer" = "Country")) |> 
  rename(Import_Long = long, Import_Lat = lat)

# update any missing coordinates
data_2_filtered_with_coords <- data_2_filtered_with_coords |> 
  left_join(special_areas_coords, by = c("Exporter" = "Country")) |> 
  mutate(
    Export_Long = coalesce(Export_Long, long),
    Export_Lat = coalesce(Export_Lat, lat)) |> 
  select(-long, -lat) |>

#### Calculating Bezier curves

Rather than directly using `geom_bezier()`, we create a custom function to 
calculate the Bezier curves. The reason for this decision is that we will later 
need to add arrows embedded in the trade flows. These arrows follow the same 
path as the trade flows but end a bit before the trade flows. Calculating the 
Bezier curves ourselves allows us to access and control the curve coordinates,
which is necessary to make the arrows shorter than the trade flows. This was 
difficult to achieve with `geom_bezier()`. 

We go for simpler quadratic Bezier curves which use just one control point. 
Here is the function that calculates these curves:

```{r}
calculate_bezier_points <- function(x1, y1, cx, cy, x2, y2, n = 100, 
                                  start_offset = 2, end_offset = 2) {
  
  # calculate points along the Bezier curve
  t <- seq(0, 1, length.out = n)
  x <- (1-t)^2 * x1 + 2*(1-t)*t * cx + t^2 * x2
  y <- (1-t)^2 * y1 + 2*(1-t)*t * cy + t^2 * y2
  points <- data.frame(x = x, y = y)
  
  # calculate distances from endpoints
  start_distances <- sqrt((x - x1)^2 + (y - y1)^2)
  end_distances <- sqrt((x - x2)^2 + (y - y2)^2)
  
  # filter points based on offset
  valid_points <- points[start_distances >= start_offset & 
                        end_distances >= end_offset, ]
  
  # safety check: in case we filtered out too many points, 
  # return a minimal valid set
  # rule: if filtering left us with fewer than 3 points 
  # (which would create a poor curve), then: 
    # (1) take just 3 points along the curve (at 15%, 50%, and 85% of the way)
    # (2) calculate their positions using the same Bezier formula
    # (3) use these as our points instead
  if(nrow(valid_points) < 3) {
    t_subset <- c(0.15, 0.5, 0.85)
    x_subset <- (1-t_subset)^2 * x1 + 
      2*(1-t_subset)*t_subset * cx + t_subset^2 * x2
    y_subset <- (1-t_subset)^2 * y1 + 
      2*(1-t_subset)*t_subset * cy + t_subset^2 * y2
    valid_points <- data.frame(x = x_subset, y = y_subset)
  }
  
  return(valid_points)
}
```

We add some offset to the start and end. Removing points that are too close to  
the start or end points will avoid overlap of the trade flows with the country
labels. For some specific cases, we will later use custom offsets. 

#### Creating initial trade flows

Now that we have our custom function to calculate Bezier curves, we need to 
determine where we want to place the control point for each trade flow. 
This control point will define how each curve bends. The process is as follows:

1. Find the midpoint between the origin and destination of each trade flow

2. Calculate how far to offset this midpoint perpendicular to the direction

3. Convert the flows into a format with three points: start, control, and end

For the offset calculation, we make it proportional to the distance between 
countries: longer trade flows get larger offsets, creating more pronounced 
curves. These decisions are based on a careful observation of the original
visualisation.

```{r}
# calculate control points for Bezier curves
trade_flows_with_bezier <- data_2_filtered_with_coords |> 
  rowwise() |> 
  mutate(
    # calculate midpoint for control point
    xm = (Export_Long + Import_Long)/2,
    ym = (Export_Lat + Import_Lat)/2,
    
    # calculate offset for control point
    dx = Import_Long - Export_Long,
    dy = Import_Lat - Export_Lat,
    dist = sqrt(dx^2 + dy^2),
    offset = 0.25 * dist,  # the result of a lot of testing
    
    # calculate control point with offset
    control_x = xm - offset * (Import_Lat - Export_Lat)/dist,
    control_y = ym + offset * (Import_Long - Export_Long)/dist) |>  
  ungroup() |> 
  # create three rows per flow (start, control, end points)
  group_by(Exporter, Importer) |> 
  summarise(
    x = c(Export_Long, control_x, Import_Long),
    y = c(Export_Lat, control_y, Import_Lat),
    point = 1:3,
    Total_Value = first(Total_Value))
```

#### Custom offsets

The case of China needs special care as it is the most cluttered label.
Specifically, we need to use custom offsets for all the trade flows to China 
that come from the West or North. If we did not use these, the ends of the trade
flows would overlap too much with the label "China". 

```{r}
# first identify links to China that need special handling
china_exporters_not_South <- data_2_filtered_with_coords |> 
  filter(Importer == "China", !Exporter %in% 
           c("Malaysia", "Thailand", "Australia", "Hong Kong", "Indonesia")) |> 
  pull(Exporter)

# set custom offsets for specific trade routes
custom_offsets <- data.frame(
  Exporter = c("Canada", "Russia", china_exporters_not_South),
  Importer = c("USA", "India", rep("China", times = 
                                     length(china_exporters_not_South))),
  start_offset = c(2.5, 2, rep(2.25, 
                               times = length(china_exporters_not_South))),
  end_offset = c(1.75, 2.5, rep(6.25, 
                                times = length(china_exporters_not_South))))
```


#### Final trade flows

Now we can combine all the previous steps to create our final trade flows. 
For each trade flow, we:

1. Apply the appropriate offsets (either custom or default) from our previous 
   calculations
   
2. Generate the curve points using our custom Bezier function

3. Scale the thickness of the flows based on trade volume

4. Create data for both the full flows and their embedded arrows

Point 3. is tricky. It is important to recognise that the thickness or sizes of
the trade flows has two parts: the size along each flow and the absolute size of
each flow compared to others.
First, we use a position-based factor (positions^1.1) to account for the varying
size or thickness along each flow. This creates the subtle tapering effect as in
the original plot.
Second, we use the absolute trade value raised to the power of 0.6 for the size
of the entire flow. 

Regarding point 4: we create two sets of coordinates for each flow; one for the 
full flow path (`x_full`, `y_full`) and one for the arrow path 
(`x_arrow`, `y_arrow`). Again, we would like the arrows to be slightly shorter.

Finally, we use the `position` variable to create color gradients along each flow.

```{r}
# calculate bezier points with custom offsets
trade_flows_with_points <- trade_flows_with_bezier |> 
  left_join(custom_offsets, by = c("Exporter", "Importer")) |> 
  group_by(Exporter, Importer) |> 
  do({
    # use the custom offsets (2.25 and 2.5) if they exist
    start_off <- ifelse(!is.na(first(.$start_offset)), 
                        first(.$start_offset), 2.25)
    end_off <- ifelse(!is.na(first(.$end_offset)), 
                      first(.$end_offset), 2.5)
    
    points <- calculate_bezier_points(
      .$x[1], .$y[1],
      .$x[2], .$y[2],
      .$x[3], .$y[3],
      n = 100,
      start_offset = start_off,
      end_offset = end_off
    )
    
    n_points <- nrow(points)
    positions <- seq(0, 1, length.out = n_points)
    
    # calculate size scaling
    value_scale <- (first(.$Total_Value)/1e6)^0.6
    thickness <- positions^1.1
    size_scaling <- thickness * value_scale * 0.08 ##
    size_scaling <- pmax(0.01, size_scaling)
    
    data.frame(
      x_full = points$x,
      y_full = points$y,
      x_arrow = c(head(points$x, -1), NA),
      y_arrow = c(head(points$y, -1), NA),
      point = 1:n_points,
      position = 1 - positions^1.3,
      size_scale = size_scaling,
      Total_Value = first(.$Total_Value)
    )
  }) |> 
  
  ungroup()
```


#### Adjusting flow sizes

The size scaling formula works well for most trade flows. But the biggest flows 
need special care. 

```{r}
# define manual size adjustments for major trade routes
manual_adjustments <- data.frame(
  Exporter = c("Canada", "UAE", "Australia", "Russia", "Areas, nes", 
               "Brazil", "USA", "Norway", "USA"),
  Importer = c("USA", "Areas, nes", "China", "China", "Germany", 
               "China", "Mexico", "Germany", "China"),
  manual_size = c(12, 8, 5.5, 3.75, 2.25, 3.5, 2.85, 2.5, 2.5) / 1.75) 

# apply manual sizes
trade_flows_with_points <- trade_flows_with_points |> 
  mutate(manual_size = NA_real_) |> 
  rows_update(manual_adjustments, by = c("Exporter", "Importer")) |> 
  group_by(Exporter, Importer) |> 
  mutate(
    size_scale = if_else(!is.na(manual_size),
                         manual_size * (size_scale / max(size_scale)),
                         size_scale)) |> 
  ungroup()
```

#### Get the colors

The original plot uses a continuous color scale to color the trade flows as they
progress from the exporting country (pinkish) to the importing country (blueish). 
We use eight different colors to approximate the continuous scale as well as
possible, again using [imagecolorpicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/).

```{r}
flow_colors <- colorRampPalette(c(
  "#01a9e9", "#3894D3", "#6188CB", "#8581ca",
  "#AA70BC", "#C662B0", "#e43998", "#D84CA5"))
```

#### Putting it all together

## Alternative visualisation

The original plot is visually appealing. It also effectively communicates the 
key patterns in global commodities trade. First, China imports massive amounts 
of commodities, reflecting its status as the world’s manufacturing powerhouse. 
Second, the US trades commodities mainly with Canada and Mexico, leading to 
relatively regional supply chains in North America. Third, intra-european trade 
is strong. Fourth, the Middle East is a major player in commodities trade.

However, the original plot still faces some issues.
First, the plot becomes cluttered in high-density trading regions, particularly 
around China and Europe. In these regions, trade flows overlap and arrows become
difficult to distinguish, potentially obscuring important patterns. 
Second, the plot uses four visual channels (flows, arrows, colours and line 
thickness) to represent the direction of trade flows. This is considered bad 
practice as one data attribute should be mapped to one visual channel only. 
Third, the plot focuses only on the 76 largest trade flows. If we wanted to add 
more flows, the readability of the plot would worsen further. In other words, 
the plot has limited scalability. 

While the original plot offers interactivity features (e.g., highlighting 
specific country's trade flows when clicking on it) to address these issues 
(especially the problem of clutter), we can explore network graphs as an 
alternative approach. Networks offer the following advantages for visualising 
this bilateral trade data. First, by freeing nodes from geographic constraints, 
we can emphasize economic relationships and reveal true trading hubs, thereby 
gaining deeper knowledge about the structural relationships in global trade. 
Second, network graphs are more scalable. Force-directed layouts handle dense 
connections much better by finding optimal node positions that minimise edge 
crossings. In this way, we could relatively easily show hundreds of trade flows.
Third, network graphs can have higher information density. As we will see, we can
color the edges to encode additional information, e.g., continental clusters or 
groupings.

We will explore two different network visualization approaches using 
force-directed layouts: Fruchterman-Reingold and Kamada-Kawai algorithms.

### 2. Network graphs

#### Fruchterman-Reingold

The [Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm](https://cs.brown.edu/people/rtamassi/gdhandbook/chapters/force-directed.pdf)
simulates a physical system where the nodes push each other away, while the
edges pull or attract connected nodes like springs. This algorithm helps us to
identify clusters or trading hubs.

```{r network_plot_1, fig.width=16, fig.height=13, out.width="100%"}

We can see that there is quite a few nodes overlapping, especially around the
key trading hubs China and the US. This complicates readability. We can apply 
jitter and use manual adjustments to re-position the nodes. We make sure that we
are strict and systematic in shifting the nodes: they are shifted as little as 
possible and the shifts are either diagonal or to the left, right, bottom or top.

```{r network_plot_2, fig.width=16, fig.height=13, out.width="100%"}

This network graph is more readable now. We can see the two key trading hubs
China and the US. The network also confirms strong intra-european trade. 
Moreover, this network also indicates the strong economic ties African and South
American countries have with China. 

#### Kamada-Kawai

Alternatively, we can use the [Kamada-Kawai algorithm](https://cs.brown.edu/people/rtamassi/gdhandbook/chapters/force-directed.pdf).
This algorithm attempts to match the visual distances between nodes to their 
actual network distances (how many "hops" it takes to get from one node to 
another). It also uses a spring system where nodes that are too close or too far
from each other compared to their network distance push apart or pull together.

```{r network_plot_3, fig.width=16, fig.height=13, out.width="100%"}
# start with the new layout
layout_kk <- layout_with_kk(g)

# assign edge colors based on source (exporter) continent
E(g)$color <- sapply(E(g), function(e) {
  source_node <- V(g)[get.edge(g, e)[1]]
  continent_colors[source_node$continent]
})

# add alpha to edge colors for better visibility
E(g)$color <- sapply(E(g)$color, function(x) {
  rgb(t(col2rgb(x)/255), alpha = 0.4)
})

# adjust node sizes to make them smaller if necessary
V(g)$size <- 10 + 12 * (node_strength / max(node_strength)) 

# set up the plot
par(bg = "white", mar = c(0.1, 0.1, 2, 8))

plot(g, 
     layout = layout_kk,
     vertex.label = V(g)$name,
     vertex.label.color = "black",
     vertex.label.cex = 1.3,
     vertex.label.font = 2,  # Added bold font
     vertex.frame.color = "white",
     edge.arrow.size = 0.15,
     edge.curved = 0.15,
     asp = 1)  # Removed edge.color as it's now set explicitly

# add title
title("Alternative visualisation - Kamada-Kawai", 
      line = 0, cex.main = 2.25)

# add the same legend, again at the bottom
legend(x = "bottom",  
       title = "",
       legend = names(continent_colors),
       fill = continent_colors,
       cex = 1.2,  
       bty = "n",
       xpd = TRUE,
       horiz = TRUE)  
```

This algorithm makes it even easier to identify the core-periphery structure 
that is defining global trade in commodities, with major economies like China 
and the US forming the core and smaller economies like Austria, Thailand or
Azerbaijan being part of the periphery.

Overall, these networks are better than maps in handling bilateral trade data.
This is primarily because networks have (1) better scalability and (2) higher
information density.
