## On Extreme poverty and GDP

[When asked](https://www.gapminder.org/questions/gms1-3/) if the world's population living in extreme poverty has halved, stayed the same, or double in the last 20 years, about two thirds of respondents will say it has doubled – when, in fact, it has more than halved, which only one in in every ten person will guess. The misconception stems out our dichotomous perception of the social classes between rich and poor, all the while an overwhelming majority of people live in between those two extremes. The inaccurate negative understanding of this economic asymmetry brings us to two key points: firstly, we *believe that everything everywhere is becoming worse* which leads to, secondly, *diverting our attention away from the actual trends* at hand.

[OurWorldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief#article-citation) takes a closer look at the current developments in poverty. Particularly, they are interested in highlighting the necessity to differentiate between people living in poverty, and people living in *extreme poverty*, i.e. living on less than 2.15\$ a day, as without this distinction we would not understand the crucial differences and trends in living standards within impoverished people. In the graph below we can observe how with this metric relates to the GDP of a country. Tackling out previously mentioned key points, we see the important share of wealth that has propelled many world regions out of extreme poverty in the last 200 years, and at the same time recognize which world regions have disproportionate percentages of extreme poverty in comparison to other regions. While it takes just a bit to understand the underlying relationship that OurWorldinData seeks to visualize, the point is that economic growth implies poverty decline, and stagnated economies imply higher poverty rates.

Hence, to quote Max Roser, the author of this graph and corresponding article, "what needs explanation is not poverty, but prosperity." I find this point particularly intriguing, and will refer back to it in my proposal for the graph improvement. However, first let us take a look at the replication of the original

### The original graph

The original graph portrays the relationship between the share living in extreme poverty and the GDP per capita in 8 world regions and the global average between the years 1817 and 2017.

### Library and fonts

To replicate the graph, the below packages and font families were used. The fonts were retrieved, for free, from Google Fonts.

```{r}

library(readxl) 
library(tidyverse) 
library(dplyr) 
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(ggtext)
library(grid)

# dowload fonts
sysfonts::font_add_google("Playfair Display", family = "playfair display")
sysfonts::font_add_google("Lato", family = "lato")
sysfonts::font_add(regular = "./Lato/Lato-Light.ttf", family = "lato_light")

# activate fonts to use them with ggplot 
showtext::showtext_auto()
```

### Retrieving and tidying the data

While OurWorldinData does normally provide a direct link to download the data used in their graphs, this specific one did not have such an option. While there is a newer, [updated version](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/the-share-of-people-living-in-extreme-poverty-vs-gdp-per-capita) of the graph, I decided to email directly the creator, Max Roser, who indicated me to the [research done by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/how-was-life-volume-ii_3d96efc5-en/full-report/component-14.html#chapter-d1e59754). It used to be that the tables with the information about extreme poverty and GDP trends were easily accessible, but now one has to scan the whole article and find the tables like a needle in a hay stack.

```{r}
gdp <- read_xlsx(path = "GDP world.xlsx")

poverty <- read_xlsx(path = "poverty world.xlsx")
names(poverty)
```

We have two data sets: gdp, 21 observations (years from 1820-2016 in arbitrary increases) over 10 variables (YEAR + country regions), and poverty, with 13 observations (years from 1820-2016 in arbitrary increases) over 9 variables (YEAR + country regions). We will go over the differences below, when we clean the data. First, we will make it tidy adhering to the idea one variable should be stored in one column. Hence, as the column names represet regions, we `pivot_longer` to create in both data sets a new columns where the region and the metric (GDP or extreme poverty index) is indicated. Finally, we `full_join` the data sets together and make GDP a numerical variable without spaces. We obtain a tibble with 221 observations over 4 variables: YEAR, region, GDP and poverty.

```{r}
############### Pivot
# gdp
gdp <- gdp |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -YEAR,        
    names_to = "region",  
    values_to = "GDP"      
  )

# poverty
poverty <- poverty |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -YEAR,          
    names_to = "region",  
    values_to = "poverty"  
  )
unique(poverty$region)


############### Combine 
world <- gdp |> 
  full_join(poverty, by = c("YEAR", "region")) |> 
  mutate(GDP = str_remove_all(GDP, pattern = "\\s")) |> 
  mutate(GDP = as.numeric(GDP)) 

world
```

### Cleaning the data

Cleaning the data posed itself as a tedious task due to various challenges. Firstly, as mentioned, the data sets differentiated each other by 8 observations and 1 variable. This is due to GDP having information (observations) during more years and having an extra region, "World," that represents the global average.

The first, and easier task, was to clean the names of the regions, as some had been spelled differently in the different data set ("Latin America and Ca**rr**ibean" vs "Latin America and Cari**bb**ean" and "South and Southeast Asia" vs "South and Southeast Asia**)**").

In hindsight, the simplest solution would have been to clean the names before merging the data sets. However, as one does learn from their mistakes, I have left my creative, but extremely unnecessarily complicated approach to the task at hand. The idea was to extract the data that contained the wrong names into a "phantom data set", clean the names, merge the poverty and GDP information (look at comments in code for more info), and the re-join that phantom data set into the original data set.

```{r}
############### Check name disparities
unique(world$region)

############### Clean South and Southeast Asia

# create new data set 
clean_southeast <- world |>
  filter(region %in% c("South and Southeast Asia", "South and Southeast Asia)")) |>
  mutate(region = "South and Southeast Asia") |>
  group_by(YEAR, region = "South and Southeast Asia") |>

  # for each group defined by YEAR and region, we automatically select  the first non-missing GDP or poverty value
  summarise(
    GDP = first(na.omit(GDP)),
    poverty = first(na.omit(poverty)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# remove south and southeast asia from original dataset 
world <- world |> 
  filter(!region %in% c("South and Southeast Asia", 
                          "South and Southeast Asia)"))

# combine data: clean_world as an extra step during the process, as when you are playing around during the cleaning or any other step, you "safe" your progress 
clean_world <- bind_rows(world, clean_southeast)

world <- clean_world

############### Clean Latin America and Caribbean

# create new data set 
clean_latin <- world |>
  filter(region %in% c("Latin America and Carribean", "Latin America and Caribbean")) |>
  mutate(region = "Latin America and Caribbean") |>
  group_by(YEAR, region = "Latin America and Caribbean") |>
  summarise(
    GDP = first(na.omit(GDP)),
    poverty = first(na.omit(poverty)),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# remove south and southeast asia from original dataset 
world <- world |> 
  filter(!region %in% c("Latin America and Carribean", 
                        "Latin America and Caribbean"))

# combine data 
clean_world <- bind_rows(world, clean_latin)
world <- clean_world
```

The second, also easy, task was to rename the "Western Offshoots" as our goal regions "Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada" and World as "Global Average." This was not strictly necessary as the annotations of the regions in the final graph will be done manually, but it did improve clarity during the replication process.

```{r}
############### Recode names 

world <- world |> 
  mutate(region = recode(region,
                         "Western Offshoots" = 
                           "Australia, New Zealand, USA and Canada"), 
         region = recode(region, "World" = "Global Average"))
```

Finally, the last, and most time-consuming step in the cleaning process was supplementing the data. The hardship with this step was not its execution per se, but figuring out which data to use for the supplementation. The original article that provided the excel tables about the world GDP and poverty trends also included tables with information about 25 countries in both these metrics. Therefore, different questions arose: does GDP need supplementation, as it already has some information for its "Global Average" region? Is the supplementation done with the means of the observations out of 25 countries? Or with the means of the observations of the countries already grouped in regions? Or maybe a mix of both? These questions were answered by trial and error, as OurWorldinData had given me no information thereof nor was there any to find in the original source. Hence, I tried different approaches and looked at its impact in later stages of the replication process. It seemed to me that the *mean of the world regions* had been used for supplementing the observations *both for poverty and GDP*, while excluding the already existing GDP information for the calculation of the average of the regions.

```{r}
# calculate means for GDP and poverty by YEAR, excluding "World"
world_mean <- world |> 
  filter(region != "Global Average") |> 
  group_by(YEAR) |> 
  summarise( # create means in new columns 
    avg_poverty = mean(poverty, na.rm = TRUE), 
    avg_gdp = mean(GDP, na.rm = TRUE), 
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# supplementing "Global Average" region
world_supplemented <- world |> 
  left_join(world_mean, by = "YEAR") |> 
  mutate( # add means if they are missing (important for GDP!)
    poverty = if_else(
      region == "Global Average" & is.na(poverty), 
      avg_poverty, 
      poverty),
    GDP = if_else(
      region == "Global Average" & is.na(GDP), 
      avg_gdp, 
      GDP)
  ) |> 
  select(-avg_poverty, -avg_gdp)  # remove temporary average columns

world <- world_supplemented

world |>
  filter(region == "Global Average")
```

There are still some years of the poverty index that have no information, these correspond to the years that existed in the GDP data set but not in the poverty data set.

### Things im (not) doing

-   fat annotations =\> idk anymore
-   year annotations =\> :/
-   arrows and dots =\> in the next days when i find the time =\> HAVE NOT FOUND TIME YET

### Lessons

My biggest enemy: me, and the grid lines (and the expansion and limits in geom_path), and the dimensions (what is dpi? dpi = 150, dpi = 300), also not knowing ⇒ once you knew it seemed so easy, but I spend hours just to find out that one thing = devastating

## Improvement

original graph strengths:

The graphs strengths include its clear comparison between the world regions wealth and poverty trends, which highlight the significant variation between regions, and its historical perspective, which provides some context for the global and regional progress. Visually, the regional facets and coloring contribute to their acute distinction and provide clarity and readability.

BAD

**Content: what it tells us**

-   Cons:
    -   Some **regions can be hard to follow** without clear focus
    -   **Oversimplification**: GDP as sole indicator of poverty reduction
-   Cons:
    -   **Too much info** in one graph?

**What I tohught:**

-   I liked the **topic and nice colors**
-   I didn't like **potentially bias story**

**What needs explanation is not poverty, but prosperity.** 

Historian Michail Moatsos has recently produced a new global dataset that goes back two centuries. The chart shows his data. According to his research three-quarters of the world lived in extreme poverty in 1820. This means they "could not afford a tiny space to live, some minimum heating capacity, and food that would not induce malnutrition.”[9](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief#note-9)

Economic growth made it possible to leave the widespread extreme poverty of the past behind. It made the difference between a society in which the majority were lacking even the most basic goods and services – food, decent housing and clothes, healthcare, public infrastructure and transport – and a society in which these products are widely available.

Growth [means](https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-economic-growth) that a society produces an increasing quantity and quality of economic goods and services. The key to economic growth is the development of technology that makes it possible to increase productivity by which these goods and services are produced.

**Because the total production in an economy equals the total income in that country – as everyone’s spending is someone else’s income – incomes grow at the same rate as production increases.**

The 9 charts show the data for different regions in the world. On the horizontal axis of each chart, you find the average income (GDP per capita) and on the vertical axis you see the share living in extreme poverty. The starting point of each trajectory shows the data for 1820 and it tells us that two centuries ago the majority of people lived in extreme poverty, no matter where in the world they were at home.^[11](https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty-in-brief#note-11)^ Since then, all world regions achieved growth – the production of goods and services increased – and the share living in poverty declined.

The previous chart showed that Sub-Saharan Africa is the poorest region. Almost 40% of the population lives in extreme poverty.

Not all African countries are struggling. In fact, most African countries have achieved good growth after the end of the oppressive colonial regimes [that hindered the growth](https://voxeu.org/article/colonialism-and-development-africa) of African economies. But in a number of countries, the situation is bad. These countries remain as poor as they were in the past. Since the economy is stagnant, poverty is too.

The majority of people in Madagascar still live in extreme poverty. Very similar to the global situation two centuries ago, three-quarters of Madagascar’s population are living in extreme poverty.

Not just economic growth, but also the distribution of that growth matters. If the inequality of income increases, the poorest can be left behind.

But without economic growth, there is no chance at all to leave poverty behind. The data from Madagascar makes clear that a reduction of inequality cannot end extreme poverty in a poor country. If inequality in Madagascar would be entirely eradicated, then everyone would live on the average income. In Madagascar, this is \$1.60 a day. For poor countries, the only way to end poverty is an increase in incomes – economic growth.

Storytelling: ![](story%20image%201.png)

![](story%20image%202.png)

=\> Streamgraphs:

-   highlight inverse relationship between poverty and GDP
-   Visual clarity: The colourblind-friendly palette ensures inclusivity

```{r, layout="l-body-outset"}
library(streamgraph)
packageVersion("streamgraph") # latest version 
```

-   Improved readability by visual order: Grouping by Global North and Global South with distinct colour schemes makes it easier to identify regional disparities =\> Sorting Global North regions at the top, Global Average in the middle, and Global South at the bottom improves narrative clarity.
-   Storytelling: highlighting the separation between developed (North) and developing (South) regions allows for clearer comparisons =\> inqualities or trends between developed (top) and developing regions (bottom) while anchoring the global average in the middle for comparison.
