# Introduction

The U.S. totaled over $5.1 trillion in trade for the year 2023. This is a truly
staggering amount and it poses the interesting question, which the major trade 
partners are. By looking at trade through this visualization we can also see
how our wold today is globalized and connected, even in times of rising global
tensions.

The original visualization can be found following [this link]https://www.voronoiapp.com/economy/-Top-Global-Trading-Partners-of-the-US-in-2023-2172).

# The Visualization
## The Data
### Getting the data and downloading the packages

First we are going to start by loading the packages. For the Flagon package we
have take a little detour, since it is not available through the regular 
R function. Therefore, we will download and load it at a later step.

```{r , message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2) 
library(rnaturalearth) 
library(showtext) 
library(sysfonts) 
library(readxl) 
library(dplyr) 
library(ggpattern) 
library(devtools) 
library(patchwork) 
library(ggtext) 
```

Luckily the data for this visualization was available and only had to be 
downloaded and then transformed to be imported into R. The original data source
is cited as comtrade, U.S. Census and WTO

```{r }
trade_data <- read_excel(paste("/Users/jasonbrunner/Documents/HSG/",
                        "HS24 inkl. Austausch/HS24 UC3M/Data Visualization/",
                        "Final Project/Data Final Project.xlsx", sep = ""), 
                        col_types = c("text","numeric"))
```

The dataset is already tidy data and is ready to modified for our visualization.
The *raw* trade data which we have imported before now has to be modified to fit 
the trade categories displayed in our visualization and later it will be 
merged with our main world dataset. 

You might wonder, why they are split in these specific categories. The reason
is, that to then later on create the legend we can't use a straight forward 
approach and will need to become a bit creative. More about this will follow
once we reach the legend.

```{r}
trade_data <- trade_data %>%
  mutate(trade_category = case_when(
    `U.S. Trade (Billion US$)` < 0.1 ~ "0",
    `U.S. Trade (Billion US$)` < 1 ~ "0.1", 
    `U.S. Trade (Billion US$)` < 10 ~ "1",
    `U.S. Trade (Billion US$)` < 100 ~ "10",
    `U.S. Trade (Billion US$)` < 1000 ~ "100",
    TRUE ~ "1000"))
```
## The map

### Creating the basic plot
The next step will be to focus on the actual world map. For this we take 
advantage of the rnaturarearth package which provides us with a comprehensive
dataset about the world. We will also need to perform a few modifications to 
better fit the original plot. As you will also notice, we filter the United 
States out of the dataset. This is because the United States are filled with 
the US Flag and therefore we need to exclude it momentarily from our base 
dataset to be able to do this modification later. 
As mentioned earlier we will now in the same step merge our trade data with the 
world data we have created so we get our base dataset to then start with our
plot. Lastly we also define the colours used in the visualization. They have 
been obtained by using an online tool to get the colour codes from any colour 
you provide it. 

Additionally we also need to download the font. Using an online tool we were
able to determine the font as "montserrat". Luckily it is also available as a
free download and we can use it for our visualization.

```{r}
world <- ne_countries()

excluded_countries <- c("French Southern and Antarctic Lands","Antarctica",
                        "Falkland Islands / Malvinas")
#removing the excluded countries and the United States
world <- world %>% 
  filter(!name_long %in% excluded_countries) %>% 
  filter(!name_long %in%  "United States")

#incorporate the trade data into to world dataset
world <- left_join(world, trade_data, by = c("name_long" = "Country"))

#defining the colours used for the map
colors <- c("#bdbcfe", "#9494cd", "#6d6f9c", "#49476a", "#21213c")

font_add_google("Montserrat", "montserrat")
showtext_auto()

```

Now we have everything ready to actually create the first draft of our 
visualization. There is still a long way to go but we can plot the first 
draft with the help of the ggplot2 package to see the map with the exclusions 
and the colours for the trade data. 

```{r}
X <- ggplot(data = world) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = as.character(trade_category)), 
          color = "#faf8f4", 
          linewidth = 0.05) +
  coord_sf(crs = "+proj=robin") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors)

X
```

After having created our first plot we will continue enhancing it and 
getting it closer to the original one. The first things that comes to mind apart
from the legend are the gridlines present in the plot and the background.
We can fix these two problems easily by adding the following lines of code
to our ggplot. In the same step we will also go ahead and add the title and 
subtitle to our plot. To make the title and subtitle look right, we also 
adjust the font corresponding to the original visualization. By defining this
in our theme, it will automatically be adjusted for all text elements.

```{r}
X <- X + theme_void() +
  labs(title = "Key Global Partners in U.S. Trade for 2023", 
       subtitle = paste("In 2023, U.S. trade totaled $5,192 billion. ",
                        "Trade with NAFTA partnes-Mexico ($803\nbillion ",
                        "and Canada ($784 billion)-accounted for 30.6% of the ",
                        "total. The European\nUnion was the next largest ",
                        "partner, contribution $986 billion, or 18.5% of total",
                        " trade.\nTrade with China amounted to $596 billion, ",
                        "representing 11.5% of the total.", sep = "")) +
  
  #now the theme is being modified to replicate the title and subtitle from the
  #original plot and in the same step we also adjust the background
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, 
                                  size = 18, 
                                  face = "bold", 
                                  colour = "#042f4a"),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#faf8f4"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.05),
        text = element_text(family = "montserrat"))
  
X
```

Now it already looks much more familiar. Let's not focus on the details like
positioning and font size yet, but we will look at the more important things 
like the legend. First of all we need to turn the legend and make it horizontal
and position it somewhat in the top right corner. We also need to fix the labels
and get rid of the NA category. 

In order to get the labels of the scale to their correct position, there were
some tricks needed. By default the labels would be centered under each category
and by moving them to the left or right they wouldn't center, since they
all have a different length.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
X <- X + theme(legend.direction = "horizontal",
        legend.position = c(0.85, 0.99),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 14, 
                                    face = "bold", 
                                    color = "#030001"),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12, 
                                   color = "#030001"),
        legend.margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0),
        panel.margin = margin(t = 500, r = 50, b = 50, l = 50)) +
  
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors, name = "U.S. Trade (Billion US$)",
                    breaks = c("0", "0.1", "1", "10", "100", "1000"),
                    labels = c("   0  ",
                               "0.1   ", 
                               "   1  ", 
                               " 10   ", 
                               "100   ", 
                               "1000  ")) +
  
  guides(fill = guide_legend(
    title.position = "top",
    title.hjust = 0.5,
    label.position = "bottom",
    label.hjust = -1,
    label.vjust = 0.5,
    keywidth = unit(1.5, "cm"),
    keyheight = unit(0.2, "cm")))

X
```

### The flag
After creating the basic map, we can start adding the details. Most 
notably, the flag is still missing. For this we are going to use the flagon 
package to get the image of the flag and the spData package for the isolated
US mainland and Alaska multipolygon. The flagon package is not available to 
be downloaded through the regular R function, therefore we must take a slightly
different approach and download it directly from github.

```{r, message=FALSE}

usa <- spData::us_states |> sf::st_union()
alaska <- spData::alaska


install_github("coolbutuseless/flagon")
library(flagon)
flag <- flags("US", filetype = "png")

X1 <- X +
  geom_sf_pattern(data = usa, 
                  pattern = 'image',
                  pattern_filename = flag,
                  pattern_type = "expand",
                  color = NA) +
  geom_sf_pattern(data = alaska, 
                  pattern = 'image', 
                  pattern_filename = flag,
                  pattern_type = "none", 
                  pattern_scale= 0.3, 
                  pattern_gravity = "southwest",
                  color = NA)+
  coord_sf(crs = "+proj=robin")


```
### The EU-27 subplot

Having fitted the flag we now continue by creating the EU-27 subplot.
First we had to define a new vector with the EU-27 countries from the original
plot. After this, the world dataset is filtered so only the EU-27 countries 
remain and we can create the new plot. After that we then only have to set the
borders so we don't get the islands in the atlantic.

```{r}
EU_27 <- c("Austria", "Belgium", "Bulgaria", "Croatia", "Cyprus", 
           "Czech Republic", "Denmark", "Estonia", "Finland", "France", 
           "Germany", "Greece", "Hungary", "Ireland", "Italy", "Latvia", 
           "Lithuania", "Luxembourg", "Malta", "Netherlands", "Poland", 
           "Portugal", "Romania", "Slovakia", "Slovenia", "Spain", "Sweden")

world_EU <- world %>% 
  filter(name_long %in% EU_27)

EU <- ggplot(data = world_EU) +
  geom_sf(fill = "#01339a", 
          color = "#faf8f4", 
          linewidth = 0.25) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(-20,40), 
           ylim = c(35,70)) +
  coord_sf(crs = "+proj=longlat") +
  theme_void()


```

### Adding them together

To finalize the map of our plot we add the EU-27 plot to the main plot. There
is a package called ggpatchwork for this, which allows us to position it and
scale it accordingly. This will now yield our final map which only needs 
the annotations to make it complete

```{r}
M <- X1 + inset_element(EU, left = 0.13, bottom = 0.4, right = 0.63, 
                       top = 0.725)

M
```

### Annotations

To finalize our plot we now need to add all the annotations. Unfortunately there
are some limits to these, since the original graph most likely hasnt been 
produced with R. To simplify the process of finding the correct font size and
beeing able to adjust it across all annotations efficiently, the fontsize is 
defined by a variable.

```{r}

font_size <- 3

X2 <- X1 +
  annotate("richtext", x = -10500000, y = 1500000,
           label = "1<br>Mexico<br><b>$803B</b>",
           size = font_size,
