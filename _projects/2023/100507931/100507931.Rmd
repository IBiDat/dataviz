According to the OECD (2013), *public trust in government* represents the confidence of citizens and businesses in the actions of government to do what is right and perceived as fair. In that sense, public trust is a fundamental indicator upon which the legitimacy and sustainability of political systems are built. EXPLANATION ON HOW PUBLIC TRUST HAS DECLINED..

What is the evolution of public trust in the United States? The following graph, published by the Pew Research Center, shows the evolution of public trust along 4 ideological lines between 1972 and 2023:

![~Public Trust in Government: 1958-2023 (Pew Research Center, 2023).~](Pew%20research%20center.png){.external width="100%"}

In line with the Pew Research Center findings, the U.S. is currently experiencing historic lows in levels of public trust. The following ideas are extracted from the graph above:

-   Public trust reached a three-decade high shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
-   Since 2007, the shares saying they can trust the government has not surpassed 30%
-   While Republicans express more pronounced levels of trust, Democrats' attitudes have tended to be somewhat more consistent.

The purpose of this post is to replicate the original graph, while proposing an alternative form of visualization that illustrates the main takeaways.

## Cleaning the data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggtext)
```

Data on surveys was obtained through different sources, such as the National Election Studies, Gallup, ABC/Washington Post, CBS/New York Times, CNN Polls, and Pew Research Center (from 2020 onward, data is collected through Pew Research Center’s online American Trends Panel; whereas data before 2020 was obtained through traditional telephone surveys). This data is available in csv format and consists on 134 observations representing public trust levels over time among 4 ideological lines.

```{r}
data <-
  read_csv(file = "chart-export-6dcaa713-b94d-4cb5-b91e-e8d433400438 (1).csv",
           skip = 3, quote = "\\.") |>
  mutate(Date = mdy(str_remove_all(Date, "\t|\"")),
         `Conservative Rep/Lean Rep` =
           as.numeric(str_remove_all(`Conservative Rep/Lean Rep`, '"'))) |>
  rename(pollster = .) 

data<-na.omit(data)

colnames(data)[3] <- "Liberal_Dem"
colnames(data)[4] <- "Cons_Dem"
colnames(data)[5] <- "Liberal_Rep"
colnames(data)[6] <- "Cons_Rep"

summary(data)
```

## Building the chart

Since the background of the graph is divided by presidential terms, the first step implies creating a vector of date strings for the start and end dates. I firstly established the intervals for the terms of Presidents Ford, Reagan, Clinton, Obama, and Biden. These intervals are then organized into a data frame named `colored`. Additionally, a vector assigns distinct colors to each president name, which will be used for the annotations. Similarly, I created a second set of intervals for Presidents Nixon, Carter, H.W. Bush, W. Bush, and Trump, creating a data frame named `white`. These are later used for coloring specific background areas of the plot.

```{r}
colored_xmin <- c("1974-12-01", "1980-11-07", "1993-01-17",  
                  "2008-12-21","2021-04-11")
colored_xmax <- c("1977-04-25", "1989-01-15","2001-01-17", 
                  "2017-04-11","2023-06-11")
colored <- data.frame(xmin = as.Date(colored_xmin),
                        xmax = as.Date(colored_xmax),
                        interval = c("Ford","Reagan",
                                    "Clinton", "Obama","Biden" ))
colored_interval <-  c("Ford" = "#C81518", "Reagan" = "#C81518",
                         "Clinton" = "#2E5A87", "Obama" = "#2E5A87", 
                         "Biden" = "#2E5A87")
  
white_xmin <- c("1972-10-15", "1977-04-25", "1989-01-15",
                "2001-01-17","2017-04-11")
white_xmax <- c("1974-12-01","1980-11-07","1993-01-17",
                  "2008-12-21","2021-04-11")
white <- data.frame(xmin = as.Date(white_xmin),
                      xmax = as.Date(white_xmax),
                      interval = c("Nixon", "Carter","H.W.Bush", 
                                   "W.Bush", "Trump"))
white_interval <- c("Nixon" = "#C81518","Carter" = "#2E5A87",
                      "H.W.Bush" = "#C81518","W.Bush" = "#C81518",
                      "Trump" = "#C81518")
```

Subsequently, the `geom_rect` function applies a rectangular shape using the intervals defined in the `colored` data frame. This is needed to verify that the colored rectangles do not overlap on the lines.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
Plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = xmin, xmax = xmax, ymin = 0, ymax = 100),
            data = colored,
            fill = "#E8e8da", 
            alpha = 0.3,
            inherit.aes = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)  +
  theme_minimal()

Plot
```

The object is extended by adding multiple lines using the `geom_line` function to represent the levels of trust over time and across ideological affiliations.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}

Plot <- Plot +
   
  geom_line(aes(y = Liberal_Dem, color = "Liberal Dem/Lean Dem"), 
             linetype="solid", size=1.75, 
             alpha = 1, linejoin = "mitre", lineend= "round") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Cons_Dem, color = "Cons-Moderate Dem/Lean Dem"), 
            linetype="solid", size=1.75, 
            alpha = 1, linejoin = "mitre", lineend= "round") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Liberal_Rep, color = "Moderate-Lib Rep/Lean Rep"), 
            linetype="solid", size=1.75, 
            alpha = 1, linejoin = "mitre", lineend= "round") +
  geom_line(aes(y = Cons_Rep, color = "Conservative Rep/Lean Rep"), 
            linetype="solid", size=1.75, 
            alpha = 1, linejoin = "mitre", lineend= "round") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Conservative Rep/Lean Rep" = "#BF3B27",
                                "Liberal Dem/Lean Dem" = "#456A83",
                                "Cons-Moderate Dem/Lean Dem" = "#82A6BF",
                                "Moderate-Lib Rep/Lean Rep" = "#E37F73"),
                     breaks = c("Conservative Rep/Lean Rep", 
                                "Moderate-Lib Rep/Lean Rep", 
                                "Cons-Moderate Dem/Lean Dem", 
                                "Liberal Dem/Lean Dem"),
                     name= "") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100), 
                     breaks = seq(0, 100,by = 20),
                     expand = expansion(0)) + 
  scale_x_date(date_labels = "%Y",
               limits = c(as.Date("1972-10-15"),
                          max(data$Date)),
                breaks = seq(as.Date("1975-01-01"),  
                            max(data$Date), by = "5 years"),
               expand = expansion(0)) + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1972-10-15"), 
            color = "darkgrey", 
            size =0.5) 
 
Plot
```

### Adding text

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
Plot <- Plot +
  labs(title = "Trust in government by party and ideology",
       subtitle = "% who say they trust the government to do what is right just about always/most of the time",
       caption = "PEW RESEARCH CENTER",
        x = "",
        y = "") 

Plot
```

### Annotations

Our object is further modified by adding text annotations using the `annotate` function for the President names. The first set of annotations is based on the `colored` data frame, representing the specified presidential terms. And the second is based on the `white` data frame.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
Plot <- Plot + annotate("text", x = as.Date(colored_xmin) + 
                            (as.Date(colored_xmax) -
                               as.Date(colored_xmin))/7, 
                        y = 94, 
                        label = colored$interval, 
                        size = 4, 
                        angle = -90,  
                        color = colored_interval[colored$interval])
  
Plot <- Plot + annotate("text", x = as.Date(white_xmin) +
                            (as.Date(white_xmax) - 
                               as.Date(white_xmin))/7, 
                         y = 94, 
                        label = white$interval, 
                        angle = -90, 
                        color = white_interval[white$interval])
Plot
```

## Defining the theme

### Google fonts

I have been able to closely replicate the specific types of font by downloading them from 'google fonts' and adding them to my library.

```{r}
library(showtext)
library(sysfonts)
library(showtextdb)

sysfonts::font_add_google("Libre Franklin", family="franklin")
showtext::showtext_auto()
sysfonts::font_add_google("Playfair Display", family="playfair")
showtext::showtext_auto()
sysfonts::font_add_google("Lato", family="lato")
showtext::showtext_auto()
sysfonts::font_add_google("Almarai", family="almarai")
```

### Legend

For accurately representing the original graph, we still need to make some changes on the theme. To place the legend where is originally located in the bottom, I used the argument `legend.position`. Subsequently, I indicated the specific attributes of the letter with `legend.text`.

### Arranging the final plot

For the final details of the graph, I still needed to modify the `axis` attributes (line, text and ticks). The specifications are mostly based on the color and the size. I also had to set the margins for the `axis.text.x`. On the other hand, I set the `panel.grid` as `element_blank ()` to remove the grid lines from the plot. Finally, I specified the font, the color, the margins, and the size of the `element_text` for the title, subtitle and caption elements.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.height=6, fig.width=11}
Plot <- Plot +
   
   theme (legend.position = "bottom",
          legend.key.height = unit(0.01, "cm"), 
          legend.key.width = unit(1, "lines"), 
          legend.text = element_text(family = "almarai", size = 16, 
                                      face = "plain", color ="#4b4647"),
          axis.line.x =  element_line(color = "#696969",size = 0.7),
          axis.line.y =  element_line(color = "#a1a1a1",  size = 0.5),
          axis.text.y = element_text(margin = margin(r=0),size=16, 
                                   colour = "#696969"),
          axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t=7), size=16, 
                                   colour = "#696969"),
          axis.ticks.x = element_line(size = 0.7, color = "#696969"), 
          axis.ticks.y = element_line(size =0.7,color= "#696969"),
          axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0.15, "cm"),
          axis.ticks.length.y = unit(0.15, "cm"), 
          panel.grid = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = "#E5E5E5"),
          plot.margin = margin(t=5,b=5,r=5,l=5), 
          plot.title = element_text( face = "bold", family = "franklin", 
                                    size = 22, hjust = -0.04), 
          plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic",colour = "#8d8f8e",
                                      family = "playfair", margin = margin
                                     (t = 9, b= 30, l=),
                                     size = 17, hjust = -.05),
          plot.caption = element_text(face = "bold",hjust = 0,
                                     margin = margin ( 2,  0, 0, 1),
                                     family = "lato", size = 14)) 
 
 Plot <- Plot + theme(aspect.ratio = 1/3.3)
 Plot
```

## Alternative visualization

My purpose here is to present an alternative form of visualization to the previous graph. However, I want to ensure that key elements of the original plot remain recognizable in order to facilitate a straightforward comparison. The ultimate goal is to enhance the interpretability.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(showtext)
library(MetBrewer)
library(scico)
library(ggtext)
library(patchwork)
library(gghighlight)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
```

### Managing the data

Since I wanted to create a smoother evolution line to avoid noise , I had to reshape the data (*tidy_data*) using the `pivot_longer` function. Then, I calculated the mean number of cases for each combination of year and ideology using the `group_by` and `summarise` functions. The resulting data-frame has columns for "year," "ideology," and "mean_cases," showing the rounded mean for public trust.

```{r}
tidy_data <- data |> 
  pivot_longer(cols="Liberal_Dem":"Cons_Rep", 
               names_to = "ideology",values_to = "cases") |> 
  
  group_by(year = lubridate::year(Date), ideology) |> 
  summarise(mean_cases = round(mean(cases, na.rm = TRUE)))
  tidy_data$year <- as.numeric(tidy_data$year)
  
glimpse(tidy_data)
```

### Facet\~wrap

I believe that the original graph has room for improvement, whether through simplification, by emphasizing key data points, or reducing visual clutter. For that purpose, I used the `facet_wrap` function to visualize each ideological category individually. Subsequently, the `geom_line` function plots a line to represent the evolution of each ideology, with different colors assigned. The `geom_hline` draws a horizontal dashed line at *y = 60*. The aim is to emphasize when public trust reached levels around 60%. Finally, `gghighlight` is used to highlight the rest of the ideologies in the background of each graph.

The plots have been previously arranged to facilitate the comparison among ideologies:

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.height=5, fig.width=10}

  tidy_data <- tidy_data |>
  mutate(ideology = factor(ideology, 
                           levels = c("Liberal_Rep", 
                                      "Cons_Rep", 
                                      "Cons_Dem",
                                      "Liberal_Dem"))) |> 
  arrange(ideology, year)
  
  Plot2 <- ggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept =  60,
             linetype= "dashed", 
             size=.3, 
             color="#696969") +
  geom_line(aes(x=year, y=mean_cases, color=ideology),
            linetype="solid", 
            size=1.3, alpha = 1, 
            linejoin = "round", lineend= "round") +
  gghighlight(use_direct_label = FALSE, 
              unhighlighted_params = list(colour = alpha("white", .8))) +
  facet_wrap(~ideology, labeller = labeller
              (ideology = c ("Liberal_Rep" = "Moderate Republican",
                             "Liberal_Dem" = "Liberal Democrat",
                             "Cons_Dem" = "Conservative Democrat",    
                             "Cons_Rep" ="Conservative Republican")))  +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Cons_Rep" = "#BF3B27",
                                "Liberal_Dem" = "#456A83",
                                "Cons_Dem" = "#82A6BF",
                                "Liberal_Rep" = "#E37F73")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(tidy_data$year), 
                                 max(tidy_data$year), by = 10)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,20,40,60,80,100),
                     labels = c("", "20","40","60","","")) +
  theme_minimal( ) +
  labs(title = "Trust in government by party and ideology",
       
       subtitle = "% who say they trust the government to do what is right just about always/most of the time")
  
  Plot2 
```

### Key data points

The story I want to tell is that public trust has declined over time, reaching historic lows in the recent history of the U.S. For that purpose, i used both functions `geom_point` and `geom_text` to highlight the data points where public trust reached both its highest and lowest levels. This way, the message is clear: public trust has indeed declined.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
  Plot2 <- Plot2 +
  geom_point(data = tidy_data  |> 
               group_by(ideology) |> 
               slice(which.min(mean_cases)),
             aes(x = year, y = mean_cases,
                 color = ideology),
             shape = 16,size = 3) +
  geom_text(data = tidy_data |> 
               group_by(ideology)  |> 
               slice(which.min(mean_cases)),
             aes(x = year, y = mean_cases, 
                 color = ideology, 
                 label = mean_cases),
             hjust = -1, vjust = 1, size= 5,  fontface="bold")  +
  geom_point(data = tidy_data |> 
                 group_by(ideology) |> 
                 slice(which.max(mean_cases)),
               aes(x = year, y = mean_cases,
                   color = ideology),
               shape = 16,size = 3) +
  geom_text(data = tidy_data |>
               group_by(ideology) |> 
                slice(which.max(mean_cases)),
              aes(x = year, y = mean_cases, 
                  color = ideology,
                  label = mean_cases),
              hjust = -.7, vjust = 0, size= 5,  fontface="bold")

```

### Final theme

The main inspiration for the final theme was based on the [Consumer Confidence Around the World](https://r-graph-gallery.com/web-line-chart-small-multiple-all-group-greyed-out.html){.uri} chart from the *R Gallery*.

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
  Plot2 <- Plot2 + 
  theme(axis.title =element_blank(), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(face="bold",size=15, ),
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.y = element_text(margin = margin(r=0),size=12, 
                                   colour = "#696969"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t=7),size=12,
