 On the topic of Economics and Country Convergence
 
 Our aim will be to resort to visual tools in R studio and ggplot to study the topic of country economic growth and convergence. Classical Solow-Swan models of growth predict convergence as a function of the deviation of a country from its stationary state (natural level) such that we should expect convergence between LEDC´S and MEDC´s. 
 Our point of departure will be to launch the libraries we will use and to obtain the data from the Maddison Project Database.
 
```
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
gdp <- as.data.frame(read_delim("gdp per capita.csv", 
                                delim = ";"))
```
A prior step to develop our plot will be to clean and sort the data to prepare it for our ggplot() operations. We will filter for rows containing data for 1950 and 2016 and reshape the data to have two columns accounting for GDP per capita for each country and for each year. This enables the analyst to depict a different axis for each of the years containing observations on GDP per capita.

```
gdp <- gdp %>% 
  rename(gdp_capita = gdp_per_capita) %>% 
  select(country, year,gdp_capita, ) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1950,2016)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = gdp_capita) %>% 
  drop_na("1950", "2016") %>% 
  rename(gdp_capita_1950 = "1950", gdp_capita_2016 = "2016")
```
It will be useful for us to categorize our countries in three groups (poor, medium and rich countries) by generating a factor column using the ifelse() command in the following way:
```
gdp <- gdp %>% 
  mutate(type = ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<6000,
                       "poor",
                       ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<40000,
                              "medium",
                              "rich")))
```
Since we will have many observations for each of the countries (especially for those with middle income), we will filter for a subset of the data by selecting a random sample of middle income countries and then binding the resulting dataframe to the original one:
```
subset <- gdp %>% 
    filter(type == "medium") %>% 
  slice(sample(1:73,35,replace = FALSE))

gdp <- gdp %>% 
    filter(type != "medium") %>% 
    rbind(subset)
```
Now we have everything we need to start depicting our graph! We will call our gdp data and pipe it into the ggplot() function, defining the aesthetics desired. The advantage of having previously pivoted our data is that now we have 2 columns which account for the desired variables to be plotted:
```
plot <- gdp %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(gdp_capita_1950,gdp_capita_2016)
```
Now we will add some geometry to our plot. We will choose shape 21 in order to be able to fill the points with a different color from the one we will use for the contouring of it. 
```
plot <- plot +
  geom_point(shape = 21,color = "red", size = 1.5, fill = "aquamarine3")

```
