 On the topic of Economics and Country Convergence
 
 Our aim will be to resort to visual tools in R studio and ggplot to study the topic of country economic growth and convergence. Classical Solow-Swan models of growth predict convergence as a function of the deviation of a country from its stationary state (natural level) such that we should expect convergence between LEDC´S and MEDC´s. 
 Our point of departure will be to launch the libraries we will use and to obtain the data from the Maddison Project Database.
 
```
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
gdp <- as.data.frame(read_delim("gdp per capita.csv", 
                                delim = ";"))
```
A prior step to develop our plot will be to clean and sort the data to prepare it for our ggplot() operations. We will filter for rows containing data for 1950 and 2016 and reshape the data to have two columns accounting for GDP per capita for each country and for eachy year. 

```
gdp <- gdp %>% 
  rename(gdp_capita = gdp_per_capita) %>% 
  select(country, year,gdp_capita, ) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1950,2016)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "year", values_from = gdp_capita) %>% 
  drop_na("1950", "2016") %>% 
  rename(gdp_capita_1950 = "1950", gdp_capita_2016 = "2016")
```
It will be useful for us to categorize our countries in three groups (poor, medium and rich countries) by generating a factor column using the ifelse() command in the following way:
```
gdp <- gdp %>% 
  mutate(type = ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<6000,
                       "poor",
                       ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<40000,
                              "medium",
                              "rich")))
```
Since we will have many observations for each of the countries (especially for those with middle income), we will filter for a subset of the data by selecting a random sample of middle income countries and then binding the resulting dataframe to the original one:
```
subset <- gdp %>% 
    filter(type == "medium") %>% 
  slice(sample(1:73,35,replace = FALSE))

gdp <- gdp %>% 
    filter(type != "medium") %>% 
    rbind(subset)
```
Now we have everything we need to start depicting our graph!
