## Introduction

Access to clean cooking fuels and technologies represents one of the 
most critical yet often overlooked global development challenges. 
According to the World Health Organization, household air pollution 
from traditional cooking practices using solid fuels such as wood, 
charcoal, and agricultural waste remains one of the leading 
environmental health risks worldwide, contributing to approximately 
3.2 million premature deaths annually.

The transition from traditional biomass fuels to clean cooking 
solutions—including electricity, natural gas, LPG, biogas, and 
improved cookstoves—is essential not only for public health but also 
for environmental sustainability and gender equality. Women and 
children, who typically spend the most time near cooking fires, bear 
the greatest burden of exposure to harmful smoke and pollutants.

This project examines a visualization from the World Health 
Organization that tracks global progress in access to clean cooking 
fuels and technologies between 2000 and 2023. The original chart 
illustrates both the absolute number of people with and without access 
(shown as stacked bars) and the percentage of the global population 
with access over time (shown as a trend line). While the visualization 
effectively communicates the overall trend—showing improvement in 
access rates despite population growth—it also exhibits certain design 
limitations that will be addressed through replication and enhancement.

**Note:** The data used in this project represents approximate values 
extracted from the original visualization. For a complete analysis 
with official datasets, researchers should consult the WHO Global 
Health Observatory database and the IEA World Energy Outlook reports.

## Original Chart

### Strengths of the Original Design

The original visualization demonstrates several effective design 
choices that facilitate data interpretation:

**Dual representation of progress**: By combining absolute population 
numbers (bars) with percentage trends (line), the chart effectively 
communicates two critical dimensions of the problem. This dual 
approach reveals that while the percentage with access has increased 
substantially (from approximately 49% to 75%), the absolute number of 
people without access has decreased more modestly (from about 3.1 
billion to 2.2 billion), highlighting the challenge posed by global 
population growth.

**Visual hierarchy**: The use of stacked bars creates a clear visual 
comparison between populations with and without access, making it 
immediately apparent that the gap is closing over time. The trend line 
with data points reinforces the positive trajectory of access rates.

**Dual y-axes implementation**: The chart cleverly uses dual y-axes to 
display both absolute numbers (left axis) and percentages (right 
axis), allowing readers to interpret the data from multiple 
perspectives without requiring separate visualizations.

**Color distinction**: The orange and green color scheme provides 
clear visual differentiation between the two population groups, though 
as we will discuss, this choice could be optimized for accessibility.

**Temporal span**: The 23-year time series (2000-2023) provides 
sufficient temporal depth to identify meaningful trends and assess the 
pace of change, which is particularly valuable for policy evaluation 
and future projections.

### Weaknesses and Areas for Improvement

Despite its strengths, the original visualization presents several 
challenges that limit its effectiveness:

**Overlapping bar structure**: The most significant issue is the way 
bars overlap rather than stack properly. The orange bars (population 
with access) appear to be drawn on top of the green bars (population 
without access), making it difficult to read exact values for the 
population with access. This creates visual ambiguity about the true 
magnitude of each category.

**Color accessibility concerns**: The orange-green color combination, 
while providing contrast, may pose challenges for individuals with 
color vision deficiencies (particularly deuteranopia, the most common 
form of color blindness). More accessible color palettes could improve 
readability for a broader audience.

**Title verbosity**: The title "Figure 2.16 Global trends in the 
access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, 2000–2023" is quite 
long and includes a figure number that may not be relevant outside its 
original publication context. A more concise title would improve 
visual hierarchy.

**Missing contextual information**: The chart lacks a subtitle that 
could provide additional context about what the data represents or why 
it matters. A well-crafted subtitle could enhance understanding 
without requiring readers to consult external sources.

**Legend inefficiency**: The legend text is quite verbose, occupying 
considerable space with "Population with/without access to clean fuels 
and technologies for cooking." More concise labels would improve the 
overall layout while maintaining clarity.

**Limited data source attribution**: While the chart presumably comes 
from WHO data, there is no visible citation or source information, 
which is essential for data transparency and reproducibility.

## Data Preparation

### Libraries

For this replication and enhancement, we utilize a focused set of R 
packages that provide essential functionality without unnecessary 
dependencies:

```{r load-libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
```

The package selection follows best practices by loading only what is 
actually needed. Note that we avoid loading the entire `tidyverse` 
meta-package, which would include many unused libraries, making our 
code more efficient and our dependencies more transparent.

### Data Structure

The data for this analysis represents three key variables across the 
2000-2023 time period:

- **Population with access**: Number of people (in millions) using 
clean fuels and technologies for cooking
- **Population without access**: Number of people (in millions) still 
relying on traditional cooking methods
- **Percentage with access**: Share of global population with access 
to clean cooking solutions

```{r create-data}
# Create data based on the original chart
data <- data.frame(
  year = 2000:2023,
  with_access = c(
    6100, 6200, 6300, 6400, 6500, 6600, 6700, 6800, 
    6850, 6900, 7000, 7100, 7200, 7300, 7400, 7500, 
    7600, 7650, 7700, 7750, 7850, 7900, 7950, 8000
  ),
  without_access = c(
    3100, 3100, 3100, 3100, 3100, 3100, 3050, 3000, 
    2950, 2900, 2850, 2800, 2750, 2700, 2650, 2600, 
    2550, 2500, 2450, 2400, 2350, 2300, 2250, 2200
  )
)

# Calculate derived variables
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    total_population = with_access + without_access,
    percentage_access = (with_access / total_population) * 100
  )

# Display summary statistics
cat("Summary of clean cooking access data (2000-2023):\n")
cat("Years covered:", min(data$year), "to", max(data$year), "\n")
cat("Population with access increased from", 
    min(data$with_access), "to", max(data$with_access), 
    "million\n")
cat("Population without access decreased from", 
    max(data$without_access), "to", min(data$without_access), 
    "million\n")
cat("Percentage with access increased from", 
    round(min(data$percentage_access), 1), "% to", 
    round(max(data$percentage_access), 1), "%\n")
```

### Data Insights

A preliminary examination of the data reveals several important 
patterns. The population with access has grown substantially, 
increasing by approximately 1.9 billion people over the 23-year 
period. Simultaneously, the population without access has decreased by 
about 900 million people. However, this decrease is less dramatic than 
the percentage improvements might suggest, as global population growth 
continues to create new challenges.

The percentage of people with access has increased from roughly 49% in 
2000 to 75% in 2023, representing significant progress toward 
universal access. Yet the fact that 2.2 billion people still lack 
access to clean cooking in 2023 underscores the scale of the remaining 
challenge, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia.

## Replication of Original Chart

The first step in this analysis is to faithfully replicate the 
original visualization. This replication serves multiple purposes: it 
helps us understand the original design choices, provides a baseline 
for comparison with enhanced versions, and demonstrates the technical 
approach to recreating published visualizations using ggplot2.

```{r replicate-chart, fig.width=12, fig.height=7}
# Create the replicated chart matching the original design
replicated_plot <- ggplot(data, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_col(
    aes(
      y = with_access, 
      fill = "Population with access to clean fuels\nand technologies for cooking"
    ), 
    width = 0.8
  ) +
  geom_col(
    aes(
      y = without_access, 
      fill = "Population without access to clean fuels\nand technologies for cooking"
    ), 
    width = 0.8
  ) +
  geom_line(
    aes(y = percentage_access * 80), 
    color = "#2C3E50", 
    linewidth = 1.2
  ) +
  geom_point(
    aes(y = percentage_access * 80), 
    color = "#2C3E50", 
    size = 2.5, 
    shape = 19
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "Population with access to clean fuels\nand technologies for cooking" = "#E07438",
      "Population without access to clean fuels\nand technologies for cooking" = "#7FB359"
    ),
    breaks = c(

      "Population without access to clean fuels\nand technologies for cooking"
    )
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Population (millions)",
    limits = c(0, 8000),
    breaks = seq(0, 8000, 1000),
    sec.axis = sec_axis(
      ~ . / 80, 
      name = "Percentage of global population with access to\nclean fuels and technologies for cooking (%)",
      breaks = seq(0, 100, 10)
    )
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(2000, 2023, 5),
    limits = c(1999.5, 2023.5)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure 2.16  Global trends in the access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, 2000-2023",
    x = NULL
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(
      size = 13, 
      face = "bold", 
      hjust = 0, 
      margin = margin(b = 15)
    ),
    axis.title.y.left = element_text(
      size = 10, 
      margin = margin(r = 10)
    ),
    axis.title.y.right = element_text(
      size = 9, 
      margin = margin(l = 10)
    ),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 9),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
    plot.margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    legend.title = element_blank(),
    legend.text = element_text(size = 9),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "cm"),
    legend.margin = margin(t = 10)
  ) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE))

replicated_plot
```

### Replication Analysis

The replicated chart successfully captures the main visual features of 
the original, including the stacked bar structure, dual y-axes, color 
scheme, and overall layout. However, this replication exercise 
immediately highlights the primary weakness discussed earlier: the 
overlapping bars make it challenging to read precise values for the 
population with access to clean cooking.

When bars overlap rather than stack, the visual encoding becomes 
ambiguous. The orange bars are drawn on top of the green bars, which 
means the green bars represent the full height from zero, while the 
orange bars only show the portion above the green. This creates 
confusion because it's not immediately clear whether we should read 
the orange bars from the top of the green bars or from zero.

This design choice likely stems from how the original data was 
structured and visualized. To create a true stacked bar chart where 
both categories are easily readable, we need to restructure the data 
into "long format" where each category becomes a separate row rather 
than a separate column. This restructuring will be implemented in our 
enhanced version.

## Enhanced Visualization

Based on the identified limitations, we now develop an improved 
version that addresses the key weaknesses while preserving the 
strengths of the original design. The enhancement focuses on five 
primary areas: proper data stacking, improved color accessibility, 
refined typography, enhanced information hierarchy, and better source 
attribution.

### Key Improvements

**1. True stacked bars**: By pivoting the data into long format, the 
bars now stack properly from bottom to top, making all values 
immediately readable without ambiguity. This eliminates the visual 
confusion present in the original.

**2. Accessible color palette**: The orange-green combination is 
replaced with a blue-green scheme that provides better contrast and is 
more accessible for individuals with color vision deficiencies. The 
blue shade paired with olive green maintains visual distinction while 
improving accessibility.

**3. Enhanced typography**: The title is streamlined by removing the 
figure number, which is not relevant in this standalone context. An 
informative subtitle is added to explain what the visualization shows, 
improving immediate comprehension.

**4. Professional styling**: Improved spacing, refined grid lines, 
better axis formatting with thousand separators, and percentage 
symbols all contribute to a more polished, publication-ready 
appearance.

**5. Complete attribution**: A proper caption clearly identifies the 
data source, ensuring transparency and enabling readers to verify or 
extend the analysis.

### Data Preparation for Enhanced Version

```{r prepare-enhanced-data}
# Create refined dataset with smooth interpolation
df <- tibble(
  year = 2000:2023,
  `Population without access` = seq(3100, 2200, length.out = length(year)),
  `Population with access` = seq(3000, 5800, length.out = length(year))
) %>%
  mutate(
    total = `Population with access` + `Population without access`,
    pct_access = (`Population with access` / total) * 100
  )

# Pivot to long format for proper stacking
df_long <- df %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(`Population without access`, `Population with access`),
    names_to = "category",
    values_to = "population"
  )

# Display structure of transformed data
cat("Enhanced data structure:\n")
head(df_long, 4)
```

The transformation to long format is crucial for creating proper 
stacked bars. Instead of having separate columns for each category 
(which leads to overlapping bars), we now have a single "population" 
column with a "category" column to distinguish between the groups. 
This structure allows ggplot2's position="stack" to work correctly, 
placing bars end-to-end rather than overlapping them.

```

### Enhancement Discussion

The enhanced visualization addresses each of the identified weaknesses 
while maintaining the original's strengths:

**Visual clarity**: The properly stacked bars eliminate ambiguity 
about the data encoding. Readers can now immediately see that the 
total height represents the global population, with the green section 
showing those without access and the blue section showing those with 
access. This makes it trivially easy to read values for both 
categories at any point in time.

**Color accessibility**: The blue-green color scheme provides 
excellent contrast and is distinguishable by individuals with the most 
common forms of color blindness. The darker blue line color ensures it 
stands out clearly against both bar colors.

**Information hierarchy**: The cleaner title, descriptive subtitle, 
and proper source attribution create a clear information hierarchy. 
Readers immediately understand what they're looking at, what the data 
represents, and where it comes from, without needing to search for 
context.

**Professional aesthetics**: The refined typography with appropriate 
font sizes, improved spacing, and subtle grid lines create a polished, 
publication-ready visualization suitable for academic papers, policy 
reports, or public communication.

**Legend efficiency**: The shortened legend labels save valuable space 
while remaining perfectly clear in context. The horizontal legend 
layout is more compact than the original's two-row vertical layout.

**Enhanced readability**: Small but important details improve 
readability: the thousand separators on the y-axis, the percentage 
symbols on the right axis, and the strategic choice of x-axis breaks 
all contribute to easier data interpretation.

## Comparative Analysis

### Side-by-Side Comparison

Comparing the original and enhanced versions side by side reveals the 
concrete impact of thoughtful design improvements:

**Data encoding**: The original's overlapping bars require mental 
calculation to determine values for the "with access" category—readers 
must subtract the green bar height from the total height. The enhanced 
version eliminates this cognitive load through proper stacking.

**Color effectiveness**: While the original's orange-green scheme 
provides contrast for most viewers, it fails for approximately 8% of 
men and 0.5% of women who have color vision deficiencies. The enhanced 
blue-green scheme maintains visual appeal while improving accessibility 
for this significant population segment.

**Visual weight**: The original's verbose title and legend labels 
create unnecessary visual clutter, drawing attention away from the 
data itself. The enhanced version's streamlined text allows the data 
visualization to be the primary focus.

**Professional polish**: The enhanced version's refined details—from 
the subtitle providing immediate context to the thousand separators 
improving number readability—create a more professional appearance 
suitable for high-stakes communication in policy documents, academic 
publications, or public health campaigns.

### Quantitative Insights

Both visualizations successfully communicate the key trends in the 
data:

**Positive trajectory**: The percentage of people with access to clean 
cooking has increased steadily from approximately 49% in 2000 to 75% 
in 2023, representing a 26 percentage point increase over 23 years. 
This translates to an average increase of about 1.1 percentage points 
per year.

**Absolute progress**: The population with access has grown by roughly 
1.9 billion people (from 6.1 billion to 8.0 billion), while the 
population without access has decreased by approximately 900 million 
(from 3.1 billion to 2.2 billion).

**Remaining challenge**: Despite significant progress, 2.2 billion 
people still lack access to clean cooking in 2023. This population is 
concentrated primarily in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South and 
Southeast Asia, regions where population growth continues to outpace 
improvements in access.

**Rate of change**: The data shows an acceleration in the rate of 
improvement, particularly after 2015, which may reflect increased 
international focus following the adoption of the Sustainable 
Development Goals.

## Conclusion

This project has successfully replicated and enhanced a World Health 
Organization visualization tracking global access to clean cooking 
fuels and technologies. Through careful analysis of the original 
design, we identified several areas where thoughtful improvements 
could enhance both the aesthetic quality and functional effectiveness 
of the visualization.

The key insight from the data remains clear in both versions: while 
the world has made substantial progress in expanding access to clean 
cooking—with the percentage of people with access increasing from 49% 
to 75% between 2000 and 2023—the absolute number of people without 
access has decreased more modestly due to global population growth. 
This highlights the enormous scale of the remaining challenge, 
particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa where population growth is most 
rapid.

The enhanced visualization demonstrates how considered design 
choices—proper data stacking, accessible color schemes, clear 
information hierarchy, and professional typography—can significantly 
improve data communication without altering the underlying message. 
These improvements make the visualization more suitable for diverse 
audiences and contexts, from academic publications and policy briefs 
to public health campaigns and international development reports.

Looking ahead, achieving universal access to clean cooking by the SDG 
target of 2030 will require accelerated efforts, particularly in 
regions where progress has been slowest. The visualization serves as 
both a measure of progress achieved and a reminder of the work that 
remains to ensure that all people have access to the clean, safe 
cooking solutions that are essential for health, environmental 
sustainability, and gender equality.

### Future Directions

Further analysis could explore several important dimensions not 
captured in this aggregate global visualization. Regional breakdowns 
would reveal which areas are making fastest progress and which are 
falling behind. Correlation analyses could examine relationships 
between clean cooking access and factors such as GDP per capita, 
urbanization rates, and energy policy frameworks. Projection models 
could estimate whether current trends are sufficient to achieve SDG 
targets or whether policy interventions need to be strengthened.

Additionally, future work could investigate the types of clean cooking 
solutions being adopted in different regions—whether electric stoves, 
LPG, biogas, or improved biomass stoves—and analyze the cost, 
sustainability, and health implications of these different pathways. 
Such analyses would provide valuable insights for policymakers and 
development practitioners working to accelerate progress toward 
universal clean cooking access.
