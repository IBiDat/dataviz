## Chart Selection

Once the exclusive domain of Cold War superpowers and their state-run space agencies, space launches have become increasingly driven by commercial companies and emerging nations. This shift is clearly captured in a visualization published in *The Economist* in October 2018, titled *“The space race is dominated by new contenders,”* which presents detailed space launch data from 1957 to 2018.

The graph first distinguishes between state and commercial launch providers, revealing the decline of Cold War dominance alongside the rise of private companies. It then highlights major state actors and leading commercial agencies, bringing into focus the growing participation of Asian emerging powers in the space race. By also incorporating launch success and failure rates, the visualization shows how early space exploration was marked by frequent failures, in contrast to recent years where even commercial providers achieve success rates exceeding 95%.

This visualization was chosen for its ability to present both the global landscape and the finer details of the modern space race through multiple layers of information, without becoming overwhelming. It serves as a compelling example of how complex geopolitical and technological shifts can be communicated clearly and effectively through thoughtful visual design.

## Getting started

### Package library

This project makes use of package library in RStudio to support efficient data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Core visualization packages are combined with supplementary tools to streamline the workflow and produce clear, expressive graphics. In addition, fonts with high readability were selected to closely match the style of the original visualization, ensuring visual consistency and a polished appearance.

```{r package}
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)

# Visualization utility
library(ggtext)
library(patchwork)

# Font rendering and management
sysfonts::font_add_google("Source Sans 3", "source")
showtext::showtext_auto()
```

### Data loading and reconstruction

The primary data source for this project is Jonathan McDowell’s JSR Launch Vehicle Database, which provides comprehensive records of global space launch activities. In addition, *The Economist* has made downloadable data and a codebook available via GitHub, allowing further insight into the structure and intent of the original visualization.

Two main datasets were used: **launches**, containing records of successful and failed space launches, and **agencies**, detailing space launch providers. Prior to analysis, unnecessary variables were removed from both datasets, after which they were imported into RStudio. The datasets were then joined to create a unified data frame that served as the foundation for all subsequent data processing and visualization steps.

```{r data_load}
launches <- readr::read_csv("launches_edited.csv")
agencies <- readr::read_csv("agencies_edited.csv")

df <- launches %>%
  left_join(agencies, by = "agency", suffix = c("_launch", "_agency")) %>%
  mutate(
    state_code  = coalesce(state_code_agency,  state_code_launch),
    agency_type = coalesce(agency_type_agency, agency_type_launch)
  ) %>%
  select(-ends_with("_launch"), -ends_with("_agency"))
```

## Data processing

### Stacking levels

To ensure a consistent and interpretable visual structure, the launch providers were organized into predefined stacking levels. State and commercial providers were first separated into two broad groups, reflecting the central theme of the visualization: the transition from government-led space activity to commercially driven launches.

Within each group, major countries and agencies were assigned explicit factor levels. For state providers, these levels highlight historically dominant spacefaring nations alongside emerging participants, while commercial levels emphasize leading private companies as well as aggregated categories for smaller actors. By prefixing each level with its provider type (state or commercial), the stacking order remains unambiguous when the two groups are combined.

This structured hierarchy allows launches to be stacked in a controlled and meaningful order, preventing arbitrary sorting and ensuring that visual comparisons across time clearly communicate shifts in dominance and participation within the global space race.

```{r stack_levels}
state_levels <- c("European","United States","India","China",
                  "USSR/Russia","Japan","Other countries")
commercial_levels <- c("SpaceX","ULA","Other US companies",
                       "Arianespace","Russian companies","Mitsubishi","Other companies")

stack_levels <- c(
  paste0("state_", state_levels),
  paste0("commercial_", commercial_levels)
)
```

### Color palette

A custom color palette was created to clearly differentiate space launch providers while maintaining visual consistency. Each country and agency was assigned a unique hex color, enabling easy identification across the visualization.

The same base colors were applied to both state and commercial providers by prefixing category names, ensuring that identical actors retain a consistent visual identity. This approach supports clear comparisons across groups and enhances the readability of the multi-layered chart.

```{r color_palette}
base_palette <- c(
  "United States"   = "#a2b8d4",
  "European"        = "#f4c87a",
  "USSR/Russia"     = "#e89e98",
  "China"           = "#973c4c",
  "Japan"           = "#4f7e79",
  "India"           = "#2dbfd3",
  "Other countries" = "#a9bcc3",
  "Arianespace"       = "#f3bc5d",
  "Russian companies" = "#e9a19b",
  "Mitsubishi"        = "#527b7a",
  "Other US companies"= "#9fb6d1",
  "ULA"               = "#81a0c4",
  "SpaceX"            = "#2073a6",
  "Other companies"   = "#a9bdca"
)

stack_palette <- c(
  setNames(base_palette, paste0("state_", names(base_palette))),
  setNames(base_palette, paste0("commercial_", names(base_palette)))
)
```

### Recoding providers

This step reshapes the raw launch records into a format suitable for visualization. The data is first reduced to essential variables, and launch outcomes are simplified into success and fail to allow clear comparison over time.

Each launch is then classified as either state or commercial and grouped into standardized provider categories. Major spacefaring nations and leading commercial agencies are shown individually, while smaller actors are aggregated to avoid unnecessary complexity. These categories are converted into ordered factors to control the stacking structure of the chart.

Finally, launches are aggregated by year and outcome. Commercial launches are assigned negative values, while state launches remain positive, creating a mirrored layout that clearly contrasts the decline of state dominance with the rise of commercial providers.

```{r summary_df}
summary_df <- df %>%
  transmute(
    launch_year,
    outcome = if_else(category == "F", "fail", "success"),
    provider_side = if_else(agency_type == "state", "state", "commercial"),
    agency_stack = paste0(
      provider_side, "_",
      case_when(
        # --- state
        agency_type == "state" & state_code %in% c("F","UK","I","I-ESA","I-ELDO") ~ "European",
        agency_type == "state" & state_code == "US" ~ "United States",
        agency_type == "state" & state_code == "IN" ~ "India",
        agency_type == "state" & state_code == "CN" ~ "China",
        agency_type == "state" & state_code %in% c("SU","RU") ~ "USSR/Russia",
        agency_type == "state" & state_code == "J"  ~ "Japan",
        agency_type == "state" ~ "Other countries",

        # --- commercial
        agency_type != "state" & agency == "SPX" ~ "SpaceX",
        agency_type != "state" & str_detect(agency, "^ULA") ~ "ULA",
        agency_type != "state" & agency == "AE"  ~ "Arianespace",
        agency_type != "state" & agency == "MHI" ~ "Mitsubishi",
        agency_type != "state" & state_code == "RU" ~ "Russian companies",
        agency_type != "state" & state_code == "US" & !agency %in% c("SPX","ULA") ~ "Other US companies",
        TRUE ~ "Other companies"
      )
    ) %>% factor(levels = stack_levels)
  ) %>%
  count(launch_year, provider_side, agency_stack, outcome, name = "launches") %>%
  mutate(
    plot_value   = if_else(provider_side == "commercial", -launches, launches),
    outcome = factor(outcome, levels = c("success", "fail"))
  )
```

## Chart Replication

### Step 1: Base Stacked Bars

This first step creates the basic structure of the chart using a stacked bar plot. Annual launch counts are displayed as vertical bars, stacked by provider category to show each group’s contribution over time.

Color is used to distinguish providers, while transparency indicates launch outcomes, subtly separating successes from failures. Legends, labels, and gridlines are removed to keep the focus on the data, establishing a clean foundation for the subsequent refinement steps.

```{r plot1, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=8}
plot <- ggplot(summary_df) +
  geom_col(
    aes(x = launch_year, y = plot_value, fill = agency_stack, alpha = outcome),
    width = 1,
    position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = stack_palette, guide = "none") +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(success = 1, fail = 0.85), guide = "none") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())

plot
```

### Step 2: Adding the Center Gap

In this step, a thin “gap” layer is intentionally inserted between **state** and **commercial** stacks to create visual breathing room around the center axis. A new factor level (`commercial_gap`) is added to the stacking order, and it is assigned a transparent color so it doesn’t appear as a real category.

To make the gap consistent across all years, one synthetic row per year is generated (`gap_rows`) with a fixed size (`axis_gap`) and a negative plot value so it sits on the commercial side of the mirrored chart. These rows are then appended to the existing summarized data.

As a result, the plot gains a stable separation between the two halves, improving readability and making the mirrored structure easier to interpret.

```{r plot2, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=8}
axis_gap  <- 8
gap_level <- "commercial_gap"

stack_levels_2  <- c(paste0("state_", state_levels), gap_level, paste0("commercial_", commercial_levels))
stack_palette_2 <- c(stack_palette, commercial_gap = "transparent")

gap_rows <- distinct(summary_df, launch_year) %>%
  mutate(
    provider_side = "commercial",
    agency_stack  = factor(gap_level, levels = stack_levels_2),
    outcome       = factor("success", levels = c("success", "fail")),
    launches      = axis_gap,
    plot_value    = -axis_gap
  )

summary_df_2 <- summary_df %>%
  mutate(agency_stack = factor(as.character(agency_stack), levels = stack_levels_2)) %>%
  bind_rows(gap_rows)

plot_2 <- ggplot(summary_df_2) +
  geom_col(
    aes(launch_year, plot_value, fill = agency_stack, alpha = outcome),
    width = 1,
    position = position_stack(reverse = TRUE)
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = stack_palette_2, guide = "none") +
  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(success = 1, fail = 0.80), guide = "none") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "source"))

plot_2
```

### Step 3: Layer Separators

This step adds thin white separator lines to make the stacked layers easier to distinguish. For each year, cumulative sums are calculated to find the **boundary height** between stacked categories: one set for the state side (positive values) and another for the commercial side (negative values).

Because a gap was inserted in Step 2, the commercial boundaries are shifted downward by `axis_gap` so the lines align correctly with the mirrored layout. A small number of commercial categories are excluded from outlining to better match the visual emphasis of the original chart.

These boundaries are then drawn using `geom_segment()` as horizontal lines across each year, improving legibility without changing the underlying data.

```{r plot3, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=8}
# state boundaries (positive)
state_outline <- summary_df_2 %>%
  filter(provider_side == "state", agency_stack != "commercial_gap") %>%
  group_by(launch_year, agency_stack) %>%
  summarise(plot_value = sum(plot_value), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(launch_year, agency_stack) %>%
  group_by(launch_year) %>%
  mutate(y = cumsum(plot_value)) %>%
  ungroup()

# commercial boundaries (negative) + gap shift
comm_outline <- summary_df_2 %>%
  filter(provider_side == "commercial", agency_stack != "commercial_gap") %>%
  group_by(launch_year, agency_stack) %>%
  summarise(plot_value = sum(plot_value), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(launch_year, agency_stack) %>%
  group_by(launch_year) %>%
  mutate(y = -axis_gap + cumsum(plot_value)) %>%   # <- 핵심: gap만큼 아래로
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(!agency_stack %in% c("commercial_SpaceX", "commercial_ULA"))

plot_3 <- plot_2 +
  geom_segment(
    data = bind_rows(state_outline, comm_outline),
    aes(x = launch_year - 0.5, xend = launch_year + 0.5, y = y, yend = y),
    inherit.aes = FALSE,
    color = "white",
    linewidth = 0.4
  )

plot_3
```

### Step 4: Axes & Guide Labels

In this step, the default ggplot axes are replaced with a fully custom axis system to match the original figure’s layout and annotations. The x-range is fixed to **1957–2018**, and decade boundaries are emphasized using vertical reference lines. Custom tick marks and labels are then manually placed to show both specific years (e.g., 1957 and 2018) and decade labels (e.g., “1960s”, “1970s”).

To help readers interpret magnitude without a standard y-axis, yearly totals are calculated separately for **state** and **commercial** launches. These totals are used to place guide labels at selected launch counts (e.g., 20, 40, …), with subtle underline segments that point from the label to the relevant part of the timeline. Because the commercial side is plotted below zero and includes the inserted gap, its guide positions are shifted downward by `axis_gap` so the references align correctly.

Overall, this step adds the key framing elements—time markers and readable scale cues—while keeping the chart minimal and uncluttered.

```{r plot4, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=8}

  theme(plot.margin = margin(10, 70, 25, 25))

plot_4
```

### Step 5: Titles and Sources

This step adds narrative context to the visualization through a title, subtitle, and caption. The title clearly states the subject of the chart, while the subtitle specifies the scope of the data, including orbital range and the reference date.

A detailed caption is included to acknowledge data sources and provide clarifying notes on specific agencies and classifications. All text elements are aligned to the left of the plot area and styled with subtle size and color differences, ensuring they support the visualization without distracting from the data itself.

```{r plot5, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=8}
plot_5 <- plot_4 +
  labs(
    title    = "Space launches",
    subtitle = "To Earth orbit or higher, at October 11th 2018",
    caption  = paste(
      "Sources: FAA; Jonathan McDowell/planet4589.org; Roscosmos; press reports",
      "*United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin",
      "\u2020Non-reusable version \u2021 France, Italy and European Space Agency (ESA)",
      "The Economist",
      sep = "\n"
    )
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title.position   = "plot",
    plot.caption.position = "plot",

    plot.title = element_text(
      size = 12, face = "bold",
      hjust = 0,
      margin = margin(b = 2)
    ),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(
      size = 9, color = "grey40",
      hjust = 0,
      margin = margin(b = 10)
    ),
    plot.caption = element_text(
      size = 6, color = "grey60",
      hjust = 0,
      lineheight = 1.15,
      margin = margin(t = 10)
    )
  )

plot_5
```

### Step 6: Annotations and Key Labels

This step adds the explanatory layer that guides interpretation of the chart. First, simple arrow markers and bold text labels are placed to clarify the two halves of the mirrored layout: **state launch providers** above the midline and **commercial launch providers** below it.

Next, key countries and companies are labeled directly on the plot. Highlight labels (`geom_label`) are used where a colored block helps the name stand out against dense stacks (e.g., the U.S., Europe, USSR/Russia, China, and major U.S. commercial firms). Simpler text labels (`geom_text`) are used for smaller or less crowded areas to avoid unnecessary visual weight. Using `scale_colour_identity()` keeps these label colors independent from the main fill palette.

Finally, two narrative callouts are added: one explaining why Soviet launch counts were high (a reliability note), and another describing how launch failures were common early on but have since dropped to very high success rates. Together, these annotations turn the chart from a purely descriptive timeline into a more interpretable story about how the space race has changed.

```{r plot6, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=8}

### Step 7: Historical Milestones and Events

The final step adds historical context by annotating major milestones in spaceflight directly onto the timeline. A small event dataset is created with fixed coordinates for each callout, covering landmark achievements and failures—from **Sputnik (1957)** and **Gagarin (1961)** to **Challenger (1986)**, **Columbia (2003)**, and **Soyuz MS-10 (2018)**.

Each event is drawn using a short connector line (`geom_segment`) and a small highlighted marker (`geom_rect`) to pinpoint the exact year on the chart. The accompanying descriptions are added with `geom_richtext`, allowing simple formatting (bold text and line breaks) while keeping the annotations compact and readable.

With these callouts, the chart becomes more than a record of launch volume: it links changes in launch activity to recognizable moments in space history, helping viewers interpret the data within its broader narrative.

```{r plot7, fig.width=7.5, fig.height=8}
events <- tibble::tribble(
  ~x0, ~y0, ~x1, ~y1, ~label, 
  1957,  2, 1957, 5, "<b>Sputnik</b><br>First man-made<br>satellite",
  1961,  41, 1961, 46, "<b>Yuri<br>Gagarin</b><br>First person<br>in space",
  1965, 105, 1965,105, "<b>Alexei Leonov</b><br>First spacewalk",
  1969,  15, 1969, 15, "Apollo 11<br>First crewed<br>Moon landing",
  1986,  8, 1986, 15, "<b>Challenger</b><br>explosion",
  2003,  1, 2003, 13, "<b>Columbia</b><br>accident",
  2018,  38, 2018, 62, "<b>Soyuz MS-10</b><br>Failed to carry<br>crew to International<br>Space Station on<br>October 11th"
) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(label != "")

plot_7 <- plot_6 +
  
  geom_segment(
    data = events,
    aes(x = x0, y = y0, xend = x1, yend = y1),
    linewidth = 0.5,
    colour = "grey30",
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +

  geom_rect(
    data = events,
    aes(
      xmin = x0 - 0.6, xmax = x0 + 0.6,
      ymin = y0 - 0.7, ymax = y0 + 0.7
    ),
    fill = "white",
    colour = "grey30",
    linewidth = 0.6,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  ) +

  ggtext::geom_richtext(
    data = events,
    aes(x = x1 - 2, y = y1 + 5, label = label),
    hjust = 0, vjust = 0.5,
    fill = NA, label.color = NA,
    size = 2,
    lineheight = 1,
    inherit.aes = FALSE
  )

## Chart Improvement

This final section explores the same launch dataset through a different lens: **composition over time** rather than absolute launch volume. The data is reshaped to calculate, for each year, the **share (%)** of launches contributed by each provider group—separately for **state** and **commercial** actors.

The result is a pair of stacked **area charts**. The state panel shows how the balance among major spacefaring countries changes year by year, while the commercial panel highlights how the private market becomes increasingly concentrated around leading firms (and how smaller players collectively rise or decline). A shaded band marks the **Cold War period (1957–1991)** in the state chart, making it easier to interpret how the provider mix shifts before and after the duopoly era.

Compared with the original mirrored stacked bars—which emphasize *how many* launches occurred and how success/failure evolved—this alternative view makes it easier to see *who* dominates **within each year**, even when total launch counts change dramatically. In other words, it highlights relative influence and changing market structure that can be harder to notice in an absolute-volume timeline.
