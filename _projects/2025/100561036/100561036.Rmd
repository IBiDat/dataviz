title: "Script Version: 90% Spanish National Election Map (General Election 2023)"
description: |
  This project focuses on the replication of a selected data visualization in order to faithfully reproduce its structure, visual encodings, and underlying data transformations. The goal of the replication is to ensure transparency and technical correctness, allowing the original design decisions to be examined and understood in detail. At this stage, the project is intentionally limited to replication and remains a work in progress. Further refinements, extensions, and alternative visual approaches may be explored in subsequent iterations.
