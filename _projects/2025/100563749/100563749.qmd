## Introduction

In June of 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the historic 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, eliminating the constitutional right to abortion which had been protected for almost 50 years. The original Roe v. Wade ruling established a federally-mandated legislative framework that outlined minimum legal periods for abortion based on fetal viability, and overturning it shifted this legislative control into the hands of the states. 

The visualisation below captures the effect this overturn, illustrating two related dimensions of access, the driving distance to the closest abortion clinic and the average number of reproductive-age women that each clinic serves, used as a rough stand-in for appointment availability. It was developed by Aaron Bycoffe and Elena Mejía for the article 'What Happens If North Carolina Bans Abortion? Or Ohio? Or Florida?', published on the 8th of March 2023 by political analysis website FiveThirtyEight. The article stipulated how access to abortion would continue to change after the overturning of Roe v. Wade in June of the previous year. At the time of publish, Utah had just announced they would ban abortions and Florida and other Republican-controlled states were looking like they may follow suit. The article produced a well-developed interactive graphic that depicted the current state of abortion access and how it would change if different states were to follow in Utah's footsteps. 

The graph demonstarted that effects from changes in state abortion laws aren't contained solely to that state. Banning abortion in one state means people have to drive much further distances to attend a clinic, sometimes crossing multiple states, and neighbouring states with less restrictive abortion policy have to service a much larger population. This means that even though people living in these states may not have far to drive, it may be difficult for them to get an appointment. 

I selected this graph to replicate as I was especially interested in working with spatial data and I feel the topic is one of great importance. I thought the map was visually attractive, impactful and illustrated well the ripple effects of different states restricting abortion access. 

I replicated the graph in a static form, as per the instructions of the course, showing abortion access at the time of publish, with data provided as of February 11th 2023. The original article has been removed following Disney's takeover and shut down of FiveThirtyEight, but it can be viewed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230321155018/https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/abortion-driving-distance/) via the Internet Archive.

### Setup

Necessary libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf) # for spacial plotting 
library(tigris) # the official U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line shape files for county and state boundaries 
library(ggplot2) # graphic package
library(biscale) # bivariate thematic mapping
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE) # saving shape files locally 
library(showtext) # to install a font
library(cowplot) # to arrange plot and legends
library(readxl) # read excel files
library(grid)
```

Loading the data:

```{r}
abortion_access <- read_csv(file = "./2025.07.01_abortionaccess_countyxmonth.csv")
abortion_access <- tibble(abortion_access)
```

The dataset contains data on the driving distances to the nearest abortion facility of each U.S. county by month. It includes abortion access from January 1, 2009 to the most recently available data (last updated on August 18th 2025 ). The database was compiled by economics Professor Caitlin Myers for academic research purposes. It can be accessed on the OSF here: https://osf.io/qyh9w/overview

The data will therefore be filtered to include only those observations from February 2023.

```{r}
# Filtering to February 2023
access_feb2023 <- abortion_access |> 
  filter(year == 2023 & month == 02)
```

Loading the shapefiles and removing non-continental territories.

The shapefile data contains the state and county names, FIPS codes and geographical boundaries.

To build the map, spatial shapefile data from the U.S. Census Bureau was used. These shapefiles are accessible in R through the tigris package and contain polygon shapes for each county and state, along with identifying information like names and FIPS codes. This data was converted to simple features (sf) objects so it can be used for mapping with ggplot2, and areas outside the continental U.S. were excluded to mimic the original graph.

```{r}
non_continental <- c("02", "15", "60", "66", "69", "72", "78")  # Alaska, Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana 
                                                                # Islands, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands

counties <- counties(cb = TRUE, year = 2023) |> # Loading the county cartographic boundaries
  st_as_sf() |>                                 # Converting to an sf file
  filter(!STATEFP %in% non_continental)         # Removing non-continental USA 

states <- states(cb = TRUE, year = 2023) |> # Loading the state cartographic boundaries
  st_as_sf() |>                             # Converting to an sf file
  filter(!STATEFP %in% non_continental)     # Removing non-continental USA 
```

The data on abortion access in February 2023 was then merged with the spatial data, matching counties by their FIPS code. Nine counties in Connecticut could not be matched as they do not appear in the abortion access dataset. These counties appear with no data in the final map, but as they are small compared to the country this doesn't present any issues.

```{r}
map_data <- counties |> 
  left_join(
    access_feb2023,
    by = c("GEOID" = "origin_fips_code"))

# Number of counties that didn't get matched
map_data |> 
  filter(is.na(dest_fips_code)) |> 
  nrow()

# Unmatched counties
map_data |> 
  filter(is.na(dest_fips_code)) |> 
  select(
    GEOID,
    NAME,
    STATEFP)
```

### Checking variables for bivariate analysis

Before construction of the bivariate map, the two variables of interest (distance to the nearest abortion provider and the average service population per clinic) were examined for understanding and to ensure they were suitable for bivariate analysis. Summary statistics were generated and it was checked both variables were stored as numeric variables.

Before constructing the bivariate map, the two variables of interest—distance to the nearest abortion provider (distance_origintodest) and average service population per clinic (dest_asp)—were examined to ensure they were suitable for bivariate analysis. Summary statistics were generated to understand the range, distribution, and presence of missing values in each variable, and their data types were checked to confirm that both were numeric. Counties with missing values in either variable were then removed, as bivariate classification requires complete data for both dimensions. 

#### delete summaries?

```{r}
summary(map_data$distance_origintodest)
summary(map_data$dest_asp)

class(map_data$distance_origintodest)
class(map_data$dest_asp)
```

Observations were then classified using the bi_class() function, from the biscale package, which assigns each county to one of nine categories. These categories are dependent on the quantiles of each variables, split equally in thirds.

Bivariate classes allow the two variables related to be visualised simultaneously. The three levels of each variable are combined to form nine distinct classes, making it possible to see where the barriers overlap. In this way, you can visualise distance, congestion and the interaction of both elements, for example, counties that are both far from the nearest clinic and where that clinic has to serve a large number of patients. It provides a more nuanced picture of abortion access and helps to illustrate areas of the country most impacted by the ruling.

### Creating Bivariate Classes

```{r}
# creating classes
map_data <- map_data |> 
  filter(!is.na(distance_origintodest), !is.na(dest_asp)) |> # Removing missing values
  bi_class(x = dest_asp, 
           y = distance_origintodest,
           style = "quantile",
           dim = 3)

# Distance quantiles
quantile(
  map_data$distance_origintodest,
  probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = 4),
  na.rm = TRUE)

# Congestion (ASP) quantiles
quantile(
  map_data$dest_asp,
  probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = 4),
  na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Colour Palettes

The colour palette, although similar to the inbuilt ones in the biscale package, was customised by FiveThirtyEight. This was replicated manually, using an online colour picker tool to identify the shades from the legend and assign them to a class. This was also done for the three additional explanatory legends, which illustrate each variable separately, and the individual combination colours.

```{r}
# Main Legend
custom_palette <- c(
  "1-1" = "#f0efef", # low congestion, low distance
  "2-1" = "#dec4d8", # medium congestion, low distance 
  "3-1" = "#cb96c0", # high congestion, low distance
  "1-2" = "#bad8d9", # low congestion, medium distance
  "2-2" = "#acb0c1", # medium congestion, medium distance
  "3-2" = "#9f87ae", # high congestion, medium distance
  "1-3" = "#85c2c1", # low congestion, high distance
  "2-3" = "#7b9ead", # medium congestion, high distance
  "3-3" = "#6f789c"  # high congestion, high distance
)

# Distance
distance_palette <- c(
  "1-1" = "#f0efef", 
  "2-1" = "#fafbfc",
  "3-1" = "#fafbfc", 
  "1-2" = "#bad8d9",
  "2-2" = "#fafbfc", 
  "3-2" = "#fafbfc",
  "1-3" = "#85c2c1", 
  "2-3" = "#fafbfc",
  "3-3" = "#fafbfc" 
)

# Congestion
congestion_palette <- c(
  "1-1" = "#f0efef", 
  "2-1" = "#dec4d8",
  "3-1" = "#cb96c0", 
  "1-2" = "#fafbfc",
  "2-2" = "#fafbfc", 
  "3-2" = "#fafbfc",
  "1-3" = "#fafbfc", 
  "2-3" = "#fafbfc",
  "3-3" = "#fafbfc" 
)

# Both Metrics
both_palette <- c(
  "1-1" = "#f0efef", 
  "2-1" = "#fafbfc",
  "3-1" = "#fafbfc", 
  "1-2" = "#fafbfc",
  "2-2" = "#acb0c1",
  "3-2" = "#fafbfc",
  "1-3" = "#fafbfc", 
  "2-3" = "#fafbfc",
  "3-3" = "#6f789c" 
)
```

### Legends

Fonts

Custom fonts were added to match those of the original graph. I believe FiveThirtyEight used Decima Pro for the legend and Sequel Sans Heavy Body for the title, however, these fonts are copyrighted, so closely related fonts Work Sans and Montserrat were used instead.

```{r}
# Adding fonts
font_add("LegendFont", "WorkSans-VariableFont_wght.ttf") 
font_add("TitleFont", "Montserrat-VariableFont_wght.ttf")
showtext_opts(dpi = 300)
showtext_auto(enable = TRUE)
```

Main legend

The main legend explains the bivariate classes visually, with congestion and distance on the X and Y axis respectively. Each of the colours in the nine squares represents a combination of the two variables.

In addition, three explanatory legends were created that show separately the colours representing increases in distance, congestion, and the combination.

Combined these legends help the reader to interpret the meaning of the map.

```{r}
# Main Legend
legend <- bi_legend(pal = custom_palette, # Using custom colour palette
                    dim = 3,
                    xlab = "Congestion",  
                    ylab = "Distance", 
                    size = 11,
                    base_family = "LegendFont", 
                    arrows = TRUE) 

legend

# Distance Legend
distance_legend <- bi_legend(pal = distance_palette,
                    dim = 3,
                    xlab = " ", 
                    ylab = "LOW ---> HIGH", 
                    size = 9,
                    base_family = "LegendFont", 
                    arrows = FALSE) 

distance_legend

# Congestion Legend
congestion_legend <- bi_legend(pal = congestion_palette,
                    dim = 3,
                    xlab = "LOW ---> HIGH",  
                    ylab = " ", 
                    size = 9,
                    base_family = "LegendFont", 
                    arrows = FALSE) 

congestion_legend

# Congestion Legend
both_legend <- bi_legend(pal = both_palette,
                    dim = 3,
                    xlab = "LOW ---> HIGH", 
                    ylab = "LOW ---> HIGH", 
                    size = 9,
                    base_family = "LegendFont", 
                    arrows = FALSE) 

both_legend
```

### Arranging Explanatory Legends

The explanatory legends were then formatted and arranged. A helped function was first used to add titles above the three legends, and then they were aligned in a singlar row. Finally, the title "What happens if more states ban abortion?" and subtitle "HOW TO READ THIS MAP" were incorporated. This top section matches that of the original graph and guides viewers in interpretation of the map.

```{r}
# Function to combine the legends and title 
legend_with_title <- function(legend_plot, title_text) {
  plot_grid(
    ggdraw() +
      draw_label(
        title_text,               # Adding title 
        fontfamily = "TitleFont",
        size = 12,
        hjust = 0.5),             # Centring
    legend_plot,                  # Adding legend 
    ncol = 1,                     # One column (vertical alignment)
    rel_heights = c(0.25, 1)      # Relative heights: title, legend 
  )
}

# Using the function to create the three legend blocks
distance_block <- legend_with_title(
  distance_legend,
  "Distance increases")

congestion_block <- legend_with_title(
  congestion_legend,
  "Congestion increases")

both_block <- legend_with_title(
  both_legend,
  "Both metrics\nincrease")

# Aligning the three blocks in a row 
explanatory_legends <- plot_grid(
  distance_block,
  congestion_block,
  both_block,
  nrow = 1,    # One row
  align = "h") # Horizontally aligned 

# Stacking the legend with the title 
how_to_read_full <- plot_grid(
  ggdraw() +
    draw_label(
      "HOW TO READ THIS MAP", 
      fontfamily = "TitleFont",
      fontface = "bold",
      size = 12
    ),
  explanatory_legends, # Three explanatory legends 
  ggdraw() +
    draw_label(
      "What happens if more states ban abortion?", 
      fontfamily = "TitleFont",
      fontface = "bold",
      size = 20
    ),
  ncol = 1,
  rel_heights = c(
    0.35, # Top sub-title ("How to read") 
    1,    # Explanatory legends 
    0.4)  # Title 
)
```

#### plot.margin

### Map February 2023

The main map was created using ggplot2 where geom_sf draws the counties and colour fills them according to their bivariate class, adding state boundaries over the top. The map projection used was Alber's Equal Area, which, with some trial and error, was found to curve the map identical to the original graphic. A minimal theme was used and margin were adjusted to assist with later formatting.

```{r}
map_feb2023 <- ggplot() + 
  # Counties, fill and borders 
  geom_sf(data = map_data,
          mapping = aes(fill = bi_class), # Bi-class crated earlier of distance and asp 
          colour = "white",               # County lines 
          size = 0.0005,                  # Thinning the county lines 
          show.legend = FALSE) +
  # State lines
  geom_sf(data = states,
          fill = NA,        # States are transparent - filled by county above 
          colour = "white", # State lines
          size = 0.2,
          show.legend = FALSE) + 
  # Colour scale 
  bi_scale_fill(pal = custom_palette, 
                dim = 3) + 
  # Coordinate system: using the EPSG: 5070 (Albers Equal Area) 
  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(5070), 
           datum = NA) + # Removing latitude/ longitude lines
  # Theme 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.margin = margin( # Removing the extra margin space for formatting later
      t = 0, # Top
      r = 0, # Right
      b = 0, # Bottom
      l = 0) # Left
  )
```

### Final Graph

Finally, the map was combined with all legends and titles. Relative heights of each of the sections were adjusted to make the map the main feature, aligning with the original graph.

```{r}
# Combining both legends with the map
final_plot_wlegend <- plot_grid(
  how_to_read_full, # How to read top legend
  legend,           # Main legend
  map,              # Map
  ncol = 1,         # One column (stacked vertically)
  rel_heights = c(  # Relative size of each block 
    0.28,  # Explanatory legends
    0.12,  # Main legend
    0.60   # Map
  )
)

### Conclusion and Reflections

The bivariate graph is a good simple depiction of abortion access in the United States. It allows the reader to identify the geographical areas where access is the most difficult, according to the distance to the nearest clinic and the number of patients that clinic services. The bivariate colour scheme make it possible to identify distinctions in places where distance is the main barrier, where congestion is the main barrier, and areas where both overlap. For example, you can see that distance is the primary barrier in the West, congestion is the main concern for those in the Midwest and Southeast, and both elements interact heavily in the South.

This information can be understood with careful reading of the legends, however, interpreting the nine different colours can be time consuming. The bivariate choropleth provides a way of quickly identifying the general levels of abortion access across the country, as logically the darker areas represent where access is the most difficult, however, correctly understanding what is reveals about the two variables and their interaction is more challenging. Additionally, the static nature of my replication prevents users from seeing the exact distance, average service population, and location of the nearest clinic for each county. 

The final limitation to note is that the quantile-based classification divides the data into three groups containing an equal number of counties. As a result, counties with very different absolute levels of distance or congestion may be represented by the same category if they fall within the same quantile range. Furthermore, counties at the border of the quantiles are assigned to different categories so visually appear more distinct than counties with larger absolute differences that fall within the same quantile. While quantiles are useful for demonstrating broad geographical patterns, they can obscure the true magnitude of disparities and should be interpreted as indicating relative rather than absolute access.

## Graph Extension

This section updates the map to reflect abortion access in the United States as of August 2025, using the most recently available data. This is done to facilitate a direct comparison, and maintains the same style and methodological approach. First this is done using the same distance and congestion metrics as in the original graph, and then distance is replaced by travel cost to visually explore the differences in the financial cost of seeking an abortion. 

### Abortion Access August 2025

The abortion access dataset contains monthly observations for each county. To isolate the most recent entry, the dataset was grouped by county and filtered. A check was done to confirm the number of county observations matches that of the February 2023 dataset, ensuring the updated map reflects changes in access rather than data coverage. 

```{r}
# Most recent observations
access_aug2025 <- abortion_access |> 
  group_by(origin_fips_code) |> 
  slice_max(order_by = year * 100 + month,  # Converting date into YYYYMM in order to compare 
            with_ties = FALSE) |>           # Only one observation (should only be one observation for each month anyway)
  ungroup()

# Checking number of observations 
access_aug2025 |> nrow()
```

As in the February 2023 graph, the most August 2025 data was merged into the counties dataset. The number of missing counties remained as 9. 

```{r}
# Merging the data by FIPS code 
improved_map_data <- counties |> 
  left_join(
    access_aug2025,
    by = c("GEOID" = "origin_fips_code")
  )

# Number of unmatched counties
improved_map_data |> 
  filter(is.na(dest_fips_code)) |> 
  nrow()
```

From the comparison, congestion appears to have decreased in West Texas and northward through Colorado and Wyoming. This may be associated with the opening of new clinics in New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming, which have less restrictive abortion laws. In contrast, congestion increased around Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa and Indiana. The distance metric shows little observable change, which could reflect the fact that new clinics were primarily added in cities that already had existing facilities.

Visually, the updated graph appears to suggest modest improvements in abortion access, largely driven by reductions in congestion in West Texas. This region previously exhibited high values for both distance and congestion, corresponding to the darkest bivariate category. However, caution is warranted when interpreting this as an overall improvement, as the bivariate colour scheme makes it hard to visually assess and compare changes. Additionally, the map does not reflect population density so the number of people affected by these changes is unknown.

### Examing Travel Cost

Whilst the original map measured abortion access in terms of distance to the nearest clinic and that clinic's congestion, I wanted to take a deeper look at the financial burden of reaching these clinics and whether it changes meaningfully across the country. Relative travel costs, dependent on fuel prices and household income, disproportionately affect low-income households. To account for this, the map replaces the distance metric with travel cost, calculated as the estimated gasoline expenditure for a round trip to the nearest clinic, normalised by median household income for the county. 

#### Fuel and Income Data

Fuel prices were obtained from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/), using regular conventional retail gasoline prices for each PADD (Petroleum Administration for Defense District) region in August 2025. Weekly prices were averaged across the month to produce a single representative value per region.

Median household income data at the county level was drawn from the [USDA Economic Research Service for 2022](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/county-level-data-sets-download-data), the most recent year available. 

```{r}
# Fuel
fuel <- read_xls(path = "gasprices_region.xls",
                 sheet = "Data 1", # Regular conventional gasoline prices
                 skip = 2)

# Filtering for median income only
income <- income |> 
  filter(str_detect(Attribute, regex("income", ignore_case = TRUE)))
```

#### Merging Datasets

As the fuel dataset is reported at the PADD-region level and income data is county-specific, the two datasets were merged using a mapping of states to PADD regions. County FIPS codes were then aligned to the spatial map dataset to allow merging with the county-level abortion access data.

#### Calculating Cost of Travel

To calculate the cost of travel, the distance to the nearest clinic was multiplied by 2 to account for the return journey and fuel efficiency was assumed to be 25 miles per gallon. The total gasoline cost for the trip was calculated using the average regional gas price which was normalised by the county's monthly median household income to produce a travel cost ratio, representing the the proportion of monthly income required to travel to the nearest clinic.

This metric captures the economic burden of accessing abortion care, rather than just the physical distance, producing a more nuanced picture of abortion access across the United States. 

```{r}
improved_map_data <- improved_map_data |> 
  mutate(
    mpg = 25,                                                           # Using 25 m/g as an average
    gallons_needed = (distance_origintodest * 2) / mpg,                 # Multiplying by 2 for a round trip
    total_gas_cost = gallons_needed * Avg_Gas_Price_Aug2025, 
    travel_cost = total_gas_cost / (Median_Household_Income_2022 / 12)  # Dividing by 12 for monthly income
    ) 
```

#### Bi-variate Map with Travel Cost

A similar process to the graph replication of February 2023 and the updated August 2025 graphs was undertaken. Refer to the replication for further explanation of the methods. 

Checking if variables are numeric (necessary for bivariate analysis)
```{r}
class(improved_map_data$distance_origintodest)
class(improved_map_data$dest_asp)

Creating the bi-variate classes
```{r}
improved_map_data <- improved_map_data |> 
  filter(!is.na(dest_asp), !is.na(travel_cost)) |> 
  bi_class(
    x = dest_asp,
    y = travel_cost, 
    style = "quantile",
    dim = 3)
```

                    xlab = "Congestion -->  ",  
                    ylab = "Relative Travel Cost -->     ",

```
Comparing the distance and travel cost maps, there is almost no difference in the bivariate patterns. Minor differences are visible in Wyoming and Idaho as well as in eastern North and South Dakota, where travel costs aren't as high as you might expect based solely on distance. This is likely due to higher median household incomes or lower regional gas prices. Overall, the strong resemblance between the two maps reflects the high correlation between distance and travel cost, and indicates that distance alone is a reasonable proxy for assessing access. 

## Alternative Representation 

To address the limitations of bivariate choropleth maps, in particular the difficulty in distinguishing the effects of overlapping features as discussed in the 'Conclusion and Reflections' section, and to highlight individual clinic locations and their service populations, a bubble map is presented as an alternative.

The bubble map visualises both the financial burden of accessing abortion care and the size of the population served by each clinic across the continental United States. Whilst the previous bivariate maps illustrate relative travel cost (or distance) and congestion at the county level, the bubble map emphasises individual clinics and their reach. This map also includes information on clinic locations present in the interactive FiveThirtyEight map but lost in my static version. 

### Preparing Data

First, a new dataset was created that summarised data at the clinic level. It contained the each clinic's FIPS code, the total number of women they serve, calculated by summing the populations of all counties served by that clinic, the average service population and the number of counties they service. 

Next, geographic coordinates for each clinic were determined by calculating the centroid of the county in which the clinic is located. These coordinates were then combined with the clinic-level service information, producing a dataset that contains both the spatial location of each clinic and the number of women it serves.

```{r}
clinic_service_areas <- improved_map_data |> 
  st_drop_geometry() |>                     # Removing spatial information 
  filter(!is.na(dest_loc_id)) |> 
  group_by(dest_loc_id, dest_fips_code) |>  # Grouping by location and county
  summarise(
    total_women_served = sum(origin_population, na.rm = TRUE),  # Number of women served by the clinic 
    avg_service_pop = (first(dest_asp)),                        # Average service population of each clinic 
    counties_served = n(),                                      # Number of counties the clinic serves 
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Geographic coordinates of clinic locations
clinic_locations <- counties |> 
  filter(GEOID %in% clinic_service_areas$dest_fips_code) |> # Keeping only those counties containing clinics 
  st_centroid() |>                                          # Getting the central point of each county
  left_join(
    clinic_service_areas,
    by = c("GEOID" = "dest_fips_code")
  )
```

### Map

Like the bivariate map, the bubble map presents two variables simultaneously. 

1. Relative travel cost: represented via choropleth through the fill of the map. This is calculated as above as the estimated cost of a round trip to the nearest clinic divided by the median monthly income of a household in that county. This visually illustrates where clinic access is more or less financially burdensom. 

2. Total number of reproductive-aged women serviced by each clinic visualised by bubbles of areas proportionate to this reach. 


The bubble map uses the Conus Albers projection as in the bivariate maps 


The map uses two visual encodings simultaneously:

Background color (fill): Represents the relative travel cost, calculated as the estimated cost of a round trip to the nearest clinic divided by the median household income in that county. Lower travel costs are shown in light green (#bad8d9) and higher costs in darker green (#438584). This allows readers to see where traveling to a clinic is more or less financially burdensome.

Bubble size: Represents the total number of women served by each clinic. Larger bubbles indicate clinics serving more women, providing a sense of scale for clinic capacity and regional service coverage. Bubbles are semi-transparent with a pink fill and purple border to stand out against the background.

State boundaries are overlaid to provide geographic context, and the map uses the Conus Albers projection (EPSG 5070) to preserve relative areas across the continental United States. Legends for both travel cost and bubble size are included on the right for interpretation, with clear labels and formatted numbers to improve readability.

The resulting visualization allows readers to simultaneously understand the financial burden of traveling to a clinic and the reach of individual clinics, highlighting regions where access may be constrained by either distance, cost, or clinic capacity.

### Analysis


- shows how precarious closing one or two clinics would be 
- shows the huge difference in central vs coastal access 
- how pivitol a handful of states are (eg, colorado)


## Final Conclusion


- doesn't show differences in legislation (eg, 6 weeks vs 24 week restrictions)
