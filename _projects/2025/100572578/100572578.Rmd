# CAT: Australia Country Profile

This article details the process of replicating a graph of the Australian Country Profile created by Climate Action Tracker (CAT) in 2025.

Add contents list here

## Introduction

The CAT Project monitors government climate policies, actions and announcements to evaluate alignment with the Paris Agreement (2015) goal of limiting warming to 1.5-2°C. CAT analyses 34 countries that account for 85% of global emissions. The primary analysis for each country is assessing government action to limiting global warming. Emission gaps are calculated for each nation using emission projections and climate models to assess current policies, actions and announcements, compared to domestic and global temperature requirements.

The chosen graph for this replication is the Australian country profile. The graph (Figure 1.) details an evaluation of the emissions trajectory achievable with Australia's current climate targets, action and policies, against what is needed to domestically, and globally, limit global warming to 1.5°C (as per the Paris Agreement, 2015).

## Data and Packages  
The data has been included in a seperate file due to the legnth of the code and being unable to create one table for all necessary data to be included on the graph, 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(patchwork)
library(ggtext)
library(ggpubr)
library(grid)
library(showtext)

# load data from Rscript 
source("datascript.R")

# Font for the graph replication 
font_add_google(name = "Ubuntu", 
                family = "Ubuntu", 
                regular.wt = 400)
showtext_auto()
```
