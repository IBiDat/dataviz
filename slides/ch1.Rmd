# Principles of Graphical Excellence

.footnote[Tufte, E. R. (2018) _**The visual display of quantitative information**_. Graphics Press.]

![:vspace 20]()

--

- Graphical excellence is the **well-designed presentation** of **interesting
  data**—a matter of _substance_, of _statistics_, and of _design_.

--

- Graphical excellence consists of **complex ideas** communicated
  with **clarity, precision, and efficiency**.

--

- Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the **greatest number
  of ideas** in the **shortest time** with the **least ink** in the **smallest space**.

--

- Graphical excellence is nearly always **multivariate**.

--

- And graphical excellence requires telling the **truth** about the data.

---
class: base24

# Summary

--

- A graph

  - is a **language** to encode information;
  - converts data into **direct visual stimuli** that do not require "reading";
  - has a purpose, which is to **communicate** a summary of **complex phenomena**
    without giving up on details.

--

- As a language, it has a series of elements, **visual features**.

--

- We need to learn what's the most appropriate use of such features, and what's
  the most effective way for **mapping** data features to visual features.

--

- A good visualization can only be measured in relation to its goals, and the
  **principles of graphical excellence** by Tufte are a good starting point as
  a reference.

# Bad Charts

![:vspace 50]()

- We live surrounded by bad charts

  - For many people, statistical charts = **lie**

--

![:vspace 30]()

- Deception vs. ineptitude
  - Lack of **quantitative skills**, _anumerism_
  - Lack of knowledge about **visual perception**
  - Lack of **visual skills**
  - Intention to **deceive**

---
class: base24

# Sources of Bad Charts

- For Tufte:

  - Distortion
  - Data variation
  - Visual area and numerical measure
  - Context

--

- But there are many more **common patterns**:

  - Bad representation (deception, sometimes)
  - Bad data
  - Too many data (optimism)
  - Too little data (optimism)
  - Hiding relevant data (deception)
  - Wrong representation (deception)
  - Creativity (without skill)

# 12 Rules to Display Data Badly

--

.pull-left[
### Showing data

- Rule 1. Show as few data as possible (minimize the data density)
- Rule 2. Hide what data you do show (minimize the data-ink ratio)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Showing data accurately

- Rule 3. Ignore the visual metaphor altogether
- Rule 4. Only order matters
- Rule 5. Graph data out of context
]

--

### Showing data clearly

- Rule 6. Change scales in mid-axis
- Rule 7. Emphasize the trivial (ignore the important)
- Rule 8. Jiggle the baseline
- Rule 9. Austria first!
- Rule 10. Label illegibly, incompletely, incorrectly, and ambiguously
- Rule 11. More is murkier: more decimal places and more dimensions
- Rule 12. If it has been done well in the past, think of another way to do it

# Summary

--

- We live surrounded by **bad charts**, either by deception or ineptitude.

--

- There are some **common patterns** to be aware of.<br>
  From those, we can distill a series of **basic rules**:

--

  - Pie charts are very rarely justified.
  - Areas are tricky.
  - 3D is rarely justified in 2D mediums.
  - Axes (cuts, scales...) should be clear.
  - Proper context should be shown when relevant.
  - Do not go beyond what data tells.
  - There are **well-established visual metaphors**.
      - E.g. up-down for positive-negative.
      - E.g. areas are perceived as whole quantities,<br>
        so cutting the axis is deceiving.

# Graphical Perception
## Theory, Experimentation<br>and its Application to Data Display

---
class: base24

# Introduction

.footnote[Cleveland, W. S. (1985) _**The elements of graphing data**_. Wadsworth Inc.]

![:vspace 20]()

--

- When a graph is constructed, quantitative, categorical and ordinal data is
  **encoded** by symbols, geometry and color.

--

- _Graphical perception_ is the **visual decoding** of this encoded information.

--

- A graph is a _failure_ if the visual decoding fails.
  - No matter how intelligent the choice of information.
  - No matter how ingenious the encoding of information.
  - No matter how technologically impressive the production.

--

- Informed decisions about how to encode data must be based on knowledge of
  the visual decoding process.

class: base24

# Introduction

.footnote[Cleveland, W. S. (1985) _**The elements of graphing data**_. Wadsworth Inc.]

## Paradigm

1. A specification of **elementary graphical-perception tasks** (channels),<br>
  and an ordering of the tasks based on effectiveness.
  - Related to _pre-attentive vision_
  - As opposed to _graphical-cognition tasks_

2. A statement on the role of **distance** in graphical perception.

3. A statement on the role of **detection** in graphical perception.

![:vspace 10]()

The paradigm leads to principles of data display.

# Expressiveness Principle

# Channel Effectiveness

- **Accuracy**: How accurately values can be estimated

- **Discriminability**: How many different values can be perceived

- **Separability**: How much interaction there is with multiple encodings

- **Popout**: How easy it is to spot some values from the rest

- **Grouping**: How good a channel is in conveying groups

# Summary

![:vspace 80]()

--

- Visual encoding is the (principled) way in which data (items and attributes)
  is **mapped** to visual structures (marks and channels).

--

- Visual information should express all and **only** the information in the data,
  **highlighting** the important bits with effective channels.

--

- Channel **effectiveness** depends on accuracy, discriminability, separability,
  popout, and grouping, and there is a **ranking** based on scientific experiments
  to keep in mind for every visualization.

# Principles of Graphical Representation
## Some Useful General Guidelines

---
class: base24

# Attitude

There are three basic questions that is very useful to keep asking yourself
over and over again as you are designing new visual representations:

--

.font100[
- **What is it for?**
  - What is the problem that I am trying to solve?
  - What **questions** do I want my reader/user to be able to answer looking at this?
]

--

.font100[
- **What can I see here?**
  - What information can I extract out of this representation?
  - How much effort is it needed to extract such information?
  - How much confidence do I have in this information?
]

--

.font100[
- **How can I improve it?**
  - Being able to think about alternate solutions is<br>
    **the most important skill**
]

# General Guidelines

![:vspace 20]()

--

- **Do not over-aggregate data**

--

- **Unit-based visualizations**
  - Every data item is represented by a single graphical mark
  - Every data attribute is represented by a single channel

--

- **Tufte's _high-information graphics_**
  - "Data-rich designs give **context and credibility** to statistical evidence"
  - "High-density graphics help us **compare** parts of the data by displaying
    much information **within the view of the eye**"

--

- **Keep a critical attitude**
