The variables denoted in the chart shows the number of electoral democracies in the world based\non the Lexical Index of Electoral Democracy-classification from Skaaning et al. (2015).\nThe Lexical Index definition attained from Our World in Data establishes that it is a classification system that categorizes\npolitical systems or regimes based on easily observable characteristics. It aims to avoid difficult evaluations by experts or\nresearchers and relies on its own teams to assess specific criteria. These criterions are used to identify democracies and\nnon-democracies. The index is able to track political systems over time, measured since the year 1789, and includes 242 countries.\nThe index prioritizes straightforward and objective factors, making it a tool for quick assessments and comparisons.\nDefinitions\nTypes of Democracy in the Lexical Index:\nNon-Electoral Autocracy: A political system characterized by a single entity or a small group holding power without\nelections, often with a single autocrat or ruling elite.\nOne-Party Autocracy: A system where a single political party maintains absolute control over the government, suppressing\nthe opposition and competitive elections.\nMulti-Party Autocracy without Elected Executive: A political system with multiple parties, but the executive leader is\nnot elected democratically.\nMulti-Party Autocracy: Features multiple political parties, but the political system still retains autocratic elements.\nExclusive Democracy: Inclusive of elections but excludes certain groups or individuals from political participation.\nMale Democracy: A democracy where only male citizens are allowed to participate in elections.\nElectoral Democracy: A political system with regular elections where citizens can choose their leaders, but this may not\nguarantee full democratic rights.\nPolyarchy: A comprehensive democracy with competitive elections, civil liberties, political pluralism, and broad\nparticipation.\nThese definitions reflect the categorization of political systems within the Lexical Index, based on specific characteristics and\nlevels of inclusiveness attained from Skaaning et al. (2015), with “Polyarchy” representing the highest level of democracy and\ninclusivity.\nGetting the data\nThe dataset, obtained from Our World in Data and based on research by Skaaning et al. (2015), categorizes the world’s nations\ninto democracies and autocracies. This graphic dynamically captures the shifts in these counts from 1789 through 2022, offering\ninsights into the evolving landscape of global political systems nowadays. All the data needed for this chart can be downloaded\ndirectly from the Our World in Data website in the topic Democracy\n(https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/countries-democracies-autocracies-lexical).\n\n\ndata <- read.csv(\"data_world.csv\", sep = \";\", dec = \",\")\n\n\nBuilding the chart\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n\n\nData\nThe data scoured from Our World in Data needed to be converted to frequency tables . The graph’s vertical axis, which I aimed to\nreplicate, utilized cumulative frequency as a metric, necessitating the data’s conversion. Subsequently, I identified and chose\nthe specific columns needed for the replication, resulting in the creation of a new data-set named df_reduced.\n\n\ndf_reduced <- data %>%\n  select(Year, Frec.Non.electoral.autocracies, Frec.One.party.autocracies,\n         Frec.Multi.party.autocracies.without.elected.executive,\n         Frec.Multi.party.autocracy, Frec.Exclusive.democracies, \n         Frec.Male.democracies, Frec.Electoral.democracies, \n         Frec.Polyarchies) \n\ncustom_order <- c(\"Frec.Non.electoral.autocracies\", \"Frec.One.party.autocracies\", \n                  \"Frec.Multi.party.autocracies.without.elected.executive\",\n                  \"Frec.Multi.party.autocracy\", \"Frec.Exclusive.democracies\",\n                  \"Frec.Male.democracies\", \"Frec.Electoral.democracies\",\n                  \"Frec.Polyarchies\")\n\n\nTo enhance accessibility and facilitate the chart-building process, I converted the new dataset into tidy data. During this\nconversion, several changes were implemented, and intervals were established for the axis.\n\n\ndf_long <- df_reduced %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = \"Democracy_Type\", values_to = \"n\")\n\ndf_long <- df_long %>%\n  mutate(Democracy_Type = factor(Democracy_Type, levels = custom_order))\n\ninterval_x <- c(1789, 1850, 1900, 1950, 2000, 2022)\n\ninterval_y <- seq(0, 100, by = 0.2)   \n\n\nDue to each variable having an associated color. The following color vector was created for each value.\n\n\ndemocracy_colors <- c(\n  \"Frec.Non.electoral.autocracies\" = \"#d73027\",\n  \"Frec.One.party.autocracies\" = \"#f46d43\", \n  \"Frec.Multi.party.autocracies.without.elected.executive\" = \"#fdae61\", \n  \"Frec.Multi.party.autocracy\" = \"#fee090\", \n  \"Frec.Exclusive.democracies\" = \"#e0f3f8\",\n  \"Frec.Male.democracies\" = \"#abd9e9\",\n  \"Frec.Electoral.democracies\" = \"#74add1\", \n  \"Frec.Polyarchies\" = \"#4575b4\"\n)\n\n\nStarting with the graphic\nTo construct the visual representation, I utilized the geom_area function from ggplot, tailored for generating\nStacked Area Charts.\n\n\nplot <- ggplot(df_long, aes(x = Year, y = n, fill = Democracy_Type)) +\n  geom_area(alpha = 0.8, size = 0.2, aes(color = Democracy_Type)) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1789, 2085), breaks = interval_x, minor_breaks = NULL) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100), breaks = interval_y) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = democracy_colors) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = democracy_colors) +\n  coord_cartesian(expand=0) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(\n      color=\"#5b5b5b\", size = 10, family = \"Lato\", angle = 0, \n      hjust = c(0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1), margin = margin(t = 0)),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_line(color=\"#5b5b5b\", size = 0.2),\n    axis.ticks.length = unit(0.1, \"cm\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(\n      color=\"#5b5b5b\", size = 10, family = \"Lato\", margin = margin(r = 0))\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\n    \"Countries that are democracies and autocracies, World\", \n    subtitle = \"Political regimes based on the classification and assessment by Skaaning et al. (2015).\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(\n    color=\"#5b5b5b\", family = \"serif\", size = 15, face = \"bold\", hjust = -0.27),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(\n          color=\"#5b5b5b\", family = \"Lato\", size = 9, hjust = -0.24)\n  )\nplot\n\n\n\nI employed the intervals created during the data organization for both the x-axis and the y-axis in constructing the graphic.\nGiven that the y-axis represents frequencies in percentage, the code was modified to reflect this in the visualization. The year\nlimits were adjusted to fit the dimensions required for displaying custom labels for each democratic type. While the code’s limits\nspan from 1789 to 2085, the graphic displays the period from 1789 to 2022 on the x-axis.\nTo achieve a custom separation between each year on the x-axis, adjustments were made in the theme section, specifically in\naxis.text.x, where the spacing between each year was manually configured in order to be exactly the distance displayed\nin the graphic of reference.\nFinal touches\nI generated custom labels with corresponding colors and segments, mirroring the structure observed in the graphic that I aimed\nto replicate.\n\n\ncustom_legend <- data.frame(\n  Democracy_Type = levels(df_long$Democracy_Type),\n  x = rep(2022, length(levels(df_long$Democracy_Type))),\n  y = seq(0, 1, length.out = length(levels(df_long$Democracy_Type))),\n  label = c(\"Polyarchies\",\n            \"Electoral\\ndemocracies\",\n            \"Male\\ndemocracies\",\n            \"Exclusive\\ndemocracies\",\n            \"Multi-party\\nautocracy\",\n            \"Multi-party\\nautocracies\\nwithout elected\\nexecutive\",\n            \"One-party\\nautocracies\",\n            \"Non-electoral\\nautocracies\"\n  ),\n  label_distance = c(11, 11, 11, 21, 4, 31, 4, 8),\n  segment_distance = c(10, 10, 10, 20, 3, 30, 3, 7), \n  vertical_offset_segment = c(0.20, 0.33, 0.338, -0.16, 0.15, 0.09, 0.01, -0.04),\n  vertical_offset_label = c(0.20, 0.33, 0.338, -0.16, 0.15, 0.09, 0.01, -0.04)\n)\n\ncorrected_Democracy_Type <- rev(custom_legend$Democracy_Type)\n\n\nTo replicate the specific placement of labels and segments in the target graphic, I modified the code to permit manual\nadjustments for the angle, vertical, and horizontal placement of both text and segments. Thus, segment_distance makes\nreference to the horizontal placement of the segment and vertical_offset_segment\nis for the vertical placement.\nFurthermore, I introduced a custom legend to the plot and fine-tuned the size parameters to precisely match the dimensions of\nthe desired graphic.\n\n\nplot2 <- plot +\n  geom_text(\n    data = custom_legend,\n    aes(x = x + label_distance, \n        y = y + vertical_offset_label, \n        label = label, \n        color = corrected_Democracy_Type),\n    size = 2.5,\n    family = \"Lato\",\n    hjust = 0\n  ) +\n  geom_segment(\n    data = custom_legend,\n    aes(x = x + segment_distance, \n        xend = x + 1, \n        y = y + vertical_offset_segment, \n        yend = y + vertical_offset_segment, \n        color = \"#5b5b5b\"),\n    size = 0.5\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.margin = margin(0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3, \"cm\")\n  )\n\nplot2\n\n\n\nImproving the chart\nUpon careful consideration, I determined that there was no apparent need for enhancements in the replicated graphic. Consequently,\nI opted to generate a new visual representation utilizing the same dataset.\nBuilding the new chart\nIn an effort to retain as much of the original code as possible, I generated a new custom color palette to address perceived\ndeficiencies in the previous one. This adjustment was made to enhance visibility, ensuring that all colors are easily discernible.\nAdditionally, I maintained the code for creating custom labels in the process as I wanted to highlight that code and expand the\nuse of it to improve the new graphic.\n\n\ndemocracy_colors <- c(\n  \"Frec.Non.electoral.autocracies\" = \"#081d58\",\n  \"Frec.One.party.autocracies\" = \"#253494\",\n  \"Frec.Multi.party.autocracies.without.elected.executive\" = \"#225ea8\",\n  \"Frec.Multi.party.autocracy\" = \"#41b6c4\",\n  \"Frec.Exclusive.democracies\" = \"#7fcdbb\",\n  \"Frec.Male.democracies\" = \"#c7e9b4\",\n  \"Frec.Electoral.democracies\" = \"#1d91c0\",\n  \"Frec.Polyarchies\" = \"black\"\n)\ncustom_legend <- data.frame(\n  Democracy_Type = levels(df_long$Democracy_Type),\n  x = rep(2022, length(levels(df_long$Democracy_Type))),\n  y = seq(0, 1, length.out = length(levels(df_long$Democracy_Type))),\n  label = c(\n    \"Polyarchies\",\n    \"Electoral democracies\",\n    \"Male democracies\",\"Exclusive democracies\",\n    \"Multi-party autocracy\",\n    \"Multi-party autocracies without elected executive\",\n    \"One-party autocracies\",\n    \"Non-electoral autocracies\"\n  ),\n  label_distance = c(3, -20, 3, 3, -60, -220  , 3, -220),\n  vertical_offset_label = c(0.38, 0.17,-0.28, -0.27, -0.59, -0.32, -0.76, 0)\n)\n\ncorrected_Democracy_Type <- rev(custom_legend$Democracy_Type)\n\n\nThe chosen type of chart for improvements was a Parallel Plot utilizing the geom_line function from ggplot. I chose this\napproach as it provides a clearer representation of the evolution of each democracy type throughout the analysis period.\nIn trying to create the new graphic, I aimed for a fresh look while retaining the essence of the original one I sought to\nreplicate. To achieve this, I employed much of the existing code I had created for the previous graphic. Additionally, I\nintroduced some modifications to add distinctive elements that I deemed necessary, resulting in a new and improved interpretation\nof the same data set.\n\n\nplot_parallel_custom <- ggplot(df_long, aes(x = Year, y = n, color = Democracy_Type)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = Democracy_Type), alpha = 0.8, size = 1) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1789, 2065), breaks = interval_x, minor_breaks = NULL) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100), breaks = interval_y) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = custom_legend,\n    aes(x = x + label_distance, \n        y = y + vertical_offset_label, \n        label = label, \n        color = corrected_Democracy_Type),\n    size = 2.8,\n    family = \"Playfair Display ExtraBold\",\n    hjust = 0) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = democracy_colors) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Years\",\n    y = \"Percentage of Countries\",\n    title = \"Countries that are democracies and autocracies, World.\",\n    subtitle = \"Political regimes based on the classification and assessment by Skaaning et al.

To improve readability, I made adjustments such as changing the font\ncolor to black. Moreover, I relocated the labels inside the graphic instead of just using segments, believing that this\nmodification would enhance comprehension of each type of democracy and its evolution over time.\n\n\n\n",

Source: BBC.Replica\nIn what follows, I will provide the R code in its entirety and will also comment on some of the challenges that I came across when trying to reproduce the BBC graph.\nIt must be remarked that all data needed for this task is available here.\nAs such, the full code for the replication part is, as follows:\n\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nAmazoniaDeforestation <- read_delim(\"AmazoniaDeforestation.csv\", delim = \";\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nAmazoniaDeforestation <- as.data.frame(AmazoniaDeforestation)\n\ntext <- paste(\"O governo Bolsonaro\", \"registrou o maior\", \"desmatamento\", \"desde 2006\", sep=\"\\n\")\n\nAmazonia <- ggplot(AmazoniaDeforestation, aes(x = Year, y = Total)) +\n  geom_histogram(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"turquoise4\", width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(2.5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2021)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  ggtitle (\"Desmatamento Anual da Amazônia em km2\") +\n  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"), panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\")) +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=c(5000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000), linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2008, y = 20500, label = text, hjust=0, lineheight=1) +\n  geom_rect(aes(xmin = 2018.6, xmax = 2022, ymin = 0, ymax = 35000), fill = \"navajowhite2\", alpha = 0.01) +\n  geom_curve(aes(x = 2018, y = 17000, xend = 2021, yend = 13500), colour = \"black\",\n             arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.02, \"npc\"), type = \"open\"), curvature = -0.6) +\n  labs(caption = c(\"BBC\", \"Fonte: Inpe/Sistema PRODES\")) +\n  theme(plot.caption = element_text(hjust=c(1, 0)))\n\nAmazonia\n\n\n\nWhile I must certainly say that it has not been exceedingly hard for me to replicate the original graph, there have been some caveats here and there, nevertheless.\nIn first place, I had to address with utmost care the following line of code:\n\n\ngeom_rect(aes(xmin = 2018.6, xmax = 2022, ymin = 0, ymax = 35000), fill = \"navajowhite2\", alpha = 0.01)\n\n\nThis is because there was a risk that the chosen colour could possibly “eclipse” the colour of the bars.\nIn second place, having mentioned the colour of the bars, it took me quite a lot of time to find out which colour could most faithfully represent the bars. In the end, I ended up settling for ‘turquoise4’, as illustrated in the piece of code below:\n\n\ngeom_histogram(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"turquoise4\", width = 0.5, position = position_dodge(2.5))\n\n\nIn third place, while this may be deemed a rather inconsequential issue (though I believe that it is certainly not), I had to rigourously add the lines of text in exactly the right place—as they appear in the original graph:\n\n\ngeom_text(aes(x = 2012, y = 20500, label = \"O governo Bolsonaro\"), colour = \"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x = 2011.25, y = 19000, label = \"registrou o maior\"), colour = \"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x = 2010.9, y = 17500, label = \"desmatamento\"), colour = \"black\") +\ngeom_text(aes(x = 2010.25, y = 16000, label = \"desde 2006\"), colour = \"black\")\n\n\nPlease, note that I had to be very meticulous indeed in what to the choice of ‘x’ and ‘y’ coordinates it concerns.\nWith regard to this approach, I must say that—following Professor Iñaki Ucar’s kind suggestion—I ended up introducing a much more elegant ‘workaround’.\nThus, I first proceeded to define the text that I was going to use for the annotation, and after that I used the ‘annotate’ function:\n\n\ntext <- paste(\"O governo Bolsonaro\", \"registrou o maior\", \"desmatamento\", \"desde 2006\", sep=\"\\n\")\n\n\n\n\nannotate(\"text\", x = 2008, y = 20500, label = text, hjust=0, lineheight=1)\n\n\nIn fourth and final place, as trivial as it could possibly seem to some, I actually invested a lot of time in “getting the arrow right” in the following line of code:\n\n\ngeom_curve(aes(x = 2018, y = 17000, xend = 2021, yend = 13500), colour = \"black\",\n           arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.02, \"npc\"), type = \"open\"), curvature = -0.6)\n\n\nHere, especially, I had to be very attentive in what to “unit”, “type”, and “curvature” it refers, so that once again the obtained result could perfectly resemble the original graph.\nEnhancement\nRegarding the enhancement part, truth be told, I had a number of possible ideas in mind. On purpose of this, all credit is due to Professor Iñaki Ucar for his kind suggestions, meaningful reflections, and the time he took to discuss with me what the best outcome could be.\nAs such, I could have opted, for instance, to maintain the ‘bar structure’, while differentiating distinct time periods by means of a number of colours with basis on the colour of the ruling government at each point in time, in order to see under which government/-s deforestation was more or less prevalent.\nBut, in the end, I decided to elaborate a dynamic map of the evolution of deforestation for 1988 - 2021 period. This choice was made primarily for 2 reasons:\nNot all 9 Brazilian States have been impacted in equal measure; hence, it was—I much believe—interesting to see which ones bore more impact and which ones bore less (and also when—in time—).\nSince I had already replicated a piece of time series, I thought that it would be more challenging; hence, I would be able to learn more about Data Visualisation in R by settling for a map.\nThe code in question for the enhancement part is, as follows:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) \nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(geobr)\n\nDeforestation_Long <- \n  AmazoniaDeforestation %>%\n  select(-Total) %>%\n  pivot_longer(-Year, names_to = \"name_state\", values_to = \"Deforestated Area\") %>%\n  mutate(name_state = trimws(name_state))\n  \nAmazon <- read_amazon(showProgress = FALSE)\n\nStates <- read_state(showProgress = FALSE) %>% \n  mutate(name_state = stringi::stri_trans_general(str = name_state, id = \"Latin-ASCII\"))\n\nStates_Deforestation <- left_join(States, Deforestation_Long, by = \"name_state\") %>% \n  drop_na()\n\nDeforestation_Cumulative <- States_Deforestation %>% \n  group_by(name_state) %>% \n  mutate(\"Desmatamento Acumulado\" = cumsum(`Deforestated Area`)) %>% \n  mutate(\"Desmatamento Acumulado (%)\" = `Desmatamento Acumulado` / as.numeric(sf::st_area(geom)) * 1e6)\n\nAmazoniaStateDeforestation <- ggplot() +\n  labs(caption = \"\\n Fonte: Sistema PRODES\") +\n  geom_sf(data = st_simplify(States), colour = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_sf(data = st_simplify(Deforestation_Cumulative),\n          aes(fill = `Desmatamento Acumulado`, group = interaction(`Desmatamento Acumulado`, Year))) +\n  geom_sf(data = st_simplify(Amazon), colour = \"darkred\", size = 6, fill = NA) +\n  ggtitle(\"\\n Desmatamento Anual da Amazônia em km2: \\n Ano {round(frame_time)}\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = \"D\")\n\nAnimatedMap <- AmazoniaStateDeforestation + transition_time(Year)\n\nanimate(AnimatedMap, fps = 10, nframes = 100, duration = 10)\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, the enhancement part proved to be quite more difficult for me rather than the replication part.\nNext, I will proceed to illustrate some of the challenges that I faced:\nFirst of all, it took me a while (and several attempts in the meantime) to find the right ‘library’ for Brazil. For instance, I had initially intended to visualise the 9 Brazilian States that belong to the Amazon by means of a ‘library’ called ‘brazilmaps’. Much unfortunately, I discovered that this ‘library’ in question is very much outdated, and has a very limited number of functions. But, luckily, after some rather extensive search, I managed to find a really great ‘library’ called ‘geobr’, which suited my requirements just fine.\nIn second place, as it stems quite naturally from what has been mentioned above, I had to study all the commands that are provided in this ‘library’ before proceeding to start elaborating the map: these include, for instance, ‘read_amazon’, ‘read_meso_region’ or ‘read_states’.\nIn third place, I made a mistake when it came to the function ‘trimws()’. Thus, what I did initially was to add ‘drop_na’ after ‘left_join’ in order to discard NAs. However, the correct version is, as follows:\n\n\nmutate(name_state = trimws(name_state))\n\n\nIn fourth place, I had initially used the command ‘read_meso_region’, which turned out to not be the right one; since I was very much interested in States and not Regions. Consequently, the right piece of code is this one:\n\n\nDeforestation_Cumulative <- States_Deforestation %>% \ngroup_by(name_state)\n\n\nIn fifth place, something that I did not know was that I had to use ... (‘backticks’) instead of “…” or ‘…’ in order for R to be able to recognise that I was referring to a variable. This is very much what happened to me in the two following lines of code:\n\n\nDeforestation_Cumulative <- States_Deforestation %>% \n  group_by(name_state) %>% \n  mutate(\"Desmatamento Acumulado\" = cumsum(`Deforestated Area`)) %>% \n  mutate(\"Desmatamento Acumulado (%)\" = `Desmatamento Acumulado` / as.numeric(sf::st_area(geom)) * 1e6)\n\n\n\n\nAmazoniaStateDeforestation <- ggplot() +\n  labs(caption = \"\\n Fonte: Sistema PRODES\") +\n  geom_sf(data = st_simplify(States), colour = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_sf(data = st_simplify(Deforestation_Cumulative),\n          aes(fill = `Desmatamento Acumulado`, group = interaction(`Desmatamento Acumulado`, Year)))\n\n\nAs such, when I had initially put “Desmatamento Acumulado”, R was not able to recognise that what I had in my mind was a variale; but it did perfectly recognise Desmatamento Acumulado, of course.\nIn sixth place, an additional problem that I encountered was that due to the update of ‘sf’ R ‘library’, the animated map was not loading, due to some incompatibility between ‘sf’ and ‘transformr’ R libraries. On purpose of this, I did manage to find a temporary workaround at the end of this GitHub post. Also, as I discovered after some rather extensive search, in order to use the previous version of ‘transformr’, it was necessary to install ‘RTools’ in first place.\nIn seventh and final place, I must say that I did somewhat struggle insofar that I intended to reach the final goal (a dynamic visualisation) instead of pausing to pay more attention to the intermediate step (making sure that I had a good static visualisation in first place). In this sense, had I done that from the beginning, I much believe that some of the aforementioned mistakes could have been avoided. But I am here to learn, after all… so, no regrets!\nConclusion\nAll in all, I am very happy with what I managed to achieve: the first (replica) part is quite faithful indeed to the original BBC graph, while the second (enhancement) part does clearly show exactly what I had intended to illustrate—the unequal impact of deforestation, namely how some Amazon States were more affected than the others in time.\nThis leads me to the logical reasoning that, if I were to give a sound economic and environmental piece of advice, then I am quite convinced that Brazil would certainly be better off by enhancing its governance (concretely, its environment protection laws) on a State—rather than Nation—level.\nThis is much because, as can be seen from the map that I elaborated, while we tend to speak of the issue of deforestation of the Amazon in general terms, the root of the problem actually lies in the fact that deforestation is—and has historically been—very much concentrated in only a handful of States out of the total number of 9 States that comprise the Amazon.\nLast but not least, I am deeply grateful to Professor Iñaki Ucar for having led me in the way of acquisition of knowledge in the sphere of Data Visualisation in R.\n\n\n\n",

The HDI, calculated by the United Nations since 1990, is a summary measure of average achievement in three key dimensions of human development: life expectancy, education and have a decent standard of living (income per person.)\nThe aim of this tutorial is to reproduce the map and propose an alternative visualization using the same dataset.\nHDI map.

Since the map only shows the change between 2019 and 2021, I select a subset of the data to compute the growth change in the required period, the country name and the ISO3 code.\n\n\nHDI <- read.csv(\"HDR21-22_Composite_indices_complete_time_series.csv\")\n\nmy_data <- HDI %>%\n  select(country, iso3, hdi_2019, hdi_2021) %>%\n  mutate(change = ((hdi_2021 / hdi_2019) - 1) * 100) %>%\n  mutate(change = round(change, 1))\n\n\nTo draw the world map, the giscoR packaged is used to get the geographic information of each country in an sf format, which is required to use geom_sf in ggplot.\n\n\nworld <- giscoR::gisco_get_countries()\nclass(world)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nNow, the geographical information and the HDI data can be joined by the ISO3 code to form the complete dataset. This dataset must also be class sf, so I use st_as_sf to keep this format. Then, the Antarctica is removed from the final data, since this region does not appear in the original map.\n\n\n# checking that both data sets contain the same countries\nhdi_data <- HDI %>%\n  distinct(iso3) %>%\n  as_vector()\nnat_data <- world$ISO3_CODE\ndiffer <- as.data.frame(setdiff(hdi_data, nat_data))\n\nall_data <- st_as_sf(left_join(world, my_data, by = c(\"ISO3_CODE\" = \"iso3\")))\n\nall_data <- all_data %>% filter(!ISO3_CODE %in% c(\"ATA\"))\n\nsummary(all_data)\n\n   CNTR_ID           NAME_ENGL          ISO3_CODE        \n Length:256         Length:256         Length:256        \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n  CNTR_NAME             FID              country         \n Length:256         Length:256         Length:256        \n Class :character   Class :character   Class :character  \n Mode  :character   Mode  :character   Mode  :character  \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n                                                         \n    hdi_2019         hdi_2021          change       \n Min.   :0.3930   Min.   :0.3850   Min.   :-5.2000  \n 1st Qu.:0.6105   1st Qu.:0.5995   1st Qu.:-1.5000  \n Median :0.7460   Median :0.7390   Median :-0.9000  \n Mean   :0.7275   Mean   :0.7206   Mean   :-0.9838  \n 3rd Qu.:0.8435   3rd Qu.:0.8350   3rd Qu.:-0.3000  \n Max.   :0.9620   Max.   :0.9620   Max.   : 2.6000  \n NA's   :65       NA's   :65       NA's   :65       \n          geometry  \n MULTIPOLYGON :134  \n POLYGON      :122  \n epsg:4326    :  0  \n +proj=long...:  0  \n                    \n                    \n                    \n\nBasic elements\nMap and main legend\nTo start with, the map is plotted by using geom_sf, which automatically interprets the geographical data.\nThe fill aesthetic is set to the variable “change”, and the proper scale fill is added to fix the same breaks and colors than The Economist. The guide for it is guide_colorsteps.\nColor is fixed in white and the size in 0.1 to generate the lines for countries’ contour.\nTheme_map is added, since it sets all chart elements in blank but for the map.\n\n\nm <- ggplot(data = all_data) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = change), color = \"white\", size = 0.1) +\n  scale_fill_stepsn(\n    breaks = c(-4, -2, 0, 2),\n    colors = c(\"#be0f08\", \"#f6423c\", \"#ffa9a6\", \"#a4bfd6\", \"#1e5c98\"),\n    na.value = \"#e0ded4\",\n    guide = guide_colorsteps(\n      even.steps = TRUE,\n      order = 1,\n      ticks = TRUE,\n      ticks.colour = \"black\",\n      ticks.linewidth = 1,\n      direction = \"horizontal\",\n      title = NULL,\n      draw.llim = TRUE,\n      draw.ulim = TRUE,\n      frame.color = \"black\",\n      label.theme = element_text(size = 8))) +\n  theme_map()\n\nm\n\n\n\nSecond legend\nSince the previous legend does not show the missing values, another legend has to be configured for them. To do so, I get a very small region (Gibraltar), and add it as another map layer with color aesthetic in blank. For this aes, a scale color is defined in which a guide_legend is added specifying the proper color in the override.aes argument.\n\n\nGibraltar <- all_data %>% filter(ISO3_CODE == \"GIB\")\n\nm <- m + geom_sf(data = Gibraltar, aes(color = \"\")) +\n  scale_color_discrete(guide = guide_legend(\n    axis = FALSE,\n    label = FALSE,\n    title = \"No data\",\n    title.position = \"right\",\n    title.vjust = 0.5,\n    title.hjust = 0,\n    title.theme = element_text(\n      size = 8,\n      color = \"grey50\"),\n    override.aes = list(color = \"#e0ded4\", fill = \"#e0ded4\"),\n    order = 2,\n    direction = \"horizontal\"))\nm\n\n\n\nNow that we have both legends, we adjust them with themeoptions to place them in their correct positions and with the same spaces in between\n\n\nm <- m + theme(\n  legend.position = c(0.63, 0.95),\n  legend.key = element_rect(color = \"white\"),\n  legend.key.height = unit(2.2, \"mm\"),\n  legend.key.width = unit(4.7, \"mm\"),\n  legend.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0),\n  legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n  legend.box = \"horizontal\",\n  legend.spacing = unit(4.7, \"mm\"),\n  legend.spacing.y = unit(1, \"mm\"),\n  legend.background = element_blank())\nm\n\n\n\nProjection and annotations\nTo add the black points placed in the center of each of the countries annotated, we can filter them from the\ndataset and get their geographical centers with st_point_on_surface\nAnother dataframe is created for Australia\n\n\npoints <- all_data %>% filter(ISO3_CODE %in% c(\"LBN\", \"BGD\", \"VEN\", \"NAM\"))\ncountries_center <- st_point_on_surface(points)\n\naustralia <- all_data %>% filter(ISO3_CODE == \"AUS\")\n\n\nThen, we can add them in two different layers\n\n\nm <- m + geom_sf_text(\n  data = australia, aes(label = paste(NAME_ENGL, \"1.1\")),\n  size = 2.5,\n  color = \"#1e5c98\") +\n  geom_sf(data = countries_center, size = 0.5)\n\nm\n\n\n\nProjection\nTo this point, all the geographic information available in our dataset has been used, but the map does not look the same than the original because by default the projection used by geom_sf is the standard latitude and longitude coordinates.\nSince the one used by The Economist is the Robinson projection, the coordinate system of the map has to be changed in accordance.\n\n\nm <- m +\n  coord_sf(crs = st_crs(\"+proj=robin\"))\n\nm\n\n\n\nSpatial coordinates\nAfter changing the projection, all the following annotations must be in the same Coordinate Reference System, so a new sf object is created with the standard coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each country to be annotated and other for the end of the segment linked to it. Then, they are transformed to the Robinson projection.\n\n\nlebanon <- st_sfc(st_point(c(35.49, 33.9)), crs = 4326)\nlebanon <- st_transform(lebanon, \"+proj=robin\")\nlebanon_end <- st_sfc(st_point(c(-14, 33.9)), crs = 4326)\nlebanon_end <- st_transform(lebanon_end, \"+proj=robin\")\n\nnamibia <- st_sfc(st_point(c(17.7, -23)), crs = 4326)\nnamibia <- st_transform(namibia, \"+proj=robin\")\nnamibia_end <- st_sfc(st_point(c(8, -23)), crs = 4326)\nnamibia_end <- st_transform(namibia_end, \"+proj=robin\")\n\nvenezuela <- st_sfc(st_point(c(-65, 6.5)), crs = 4326)\nvenezuela <- st_transform(venezuela, \"+proj=robin\")\nvenezuela_end <- st_sfc(st_point(c(-85, 6.5)), crs = 4326)\nvenezuela_end <- st_transform(venezuela_end, \"+proj=robin\")\n\nbangladesh <- st_sfc(st_point(c(90, 23.7)), crs = 4326)\nbangladesh <- st_transform(bangladesh, \"+proj=robin\")\nbangladesh_end <- st_sfc(st_point(c(130, 23.7)), crs = 4326)\nbangladesh_end <- st_transform(bangladesh_end, \"+proj=robin\")\n\n\nAnnotations\nWith the elements above, segments and text annotations can be put in place using annotate. The name and the change value of each country are used as labels, and their corresponding colors are also added.\n\n\nm <- m + annotate(\"segment\",\n  x = lebanon[[1]][1], y = lebanon[[1]][2],\n  xend = lebanon_end[[1]][1], yend = lebanon_end[[1]][2], size = 0.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n    x = lebanon_end[[1]][1], y = lebanon_end[[1]][2],\n    label = \"Lebanon -5.2\",\n    hjust = 1.05,\n    color = \"#be0f08\",\n    size = 2.5) +\n  annotate(\"segment\",\n    x = namibia[[1]][1], y = namibia[[1]][2],\n    xend = namibia_end[[1]][1], yend = namibia_end[[1]][2], size = 0.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n    x = namibia_end[[1]][1], y = namibia_end[[1]][2],\n    label = \"Namibia -3.8\",\n    hjust = 1.05,\n    color = \"#f6423c\",\n    size = 2.5) +\n  annotate(\"segment\",\n    x = venezuela[[1]][1], y = venezuela[[1]][2],\n    xend = venezuela_end[[1]][1], yend = venezuela_end[[1]][2], size = 0.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n    x = venezuela_end[[1]][1], y = venezuela_end[[1]][2],\n    label = \"Venezuela -4.2\",\n    hjust = 1.05,\n    color = \"#be0f08\",\n    size = 2.5) +\n  annotate(\"segment\",\n    x = bangladesh[[1]][1], y = bangladesh[[1]][2],\n    xend = bangladesh_end[[1]][1], yend = bangladesh_end[[1]][2], size = 0.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n    x = bangladesh_end[[1]][1], y = bangladesh_end[[1]][2],\n    label = \"Bangladesh 2.6\",\n    hjust = -0.05,\n    color = \"#1e5c98\",\n    size = 2.5)\n\nm\n\n\n\nFinal result\nLastly, adding the proper title, subtitle and caption, and placing them in the same positions, the final map is achieved. The font used is “Open Sans”, which can be downloaded from Google Fonts.\n\n\nm + labs(\n  title = \"What a time to be alive\",\n  subtitle = \"Change in UN Human Development Index, 2019-21, %\",\n  caption = \"Source: United Nations\") +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      face = \"bold\",\n      family = \"Open Sans\",\n      size = 8,\n      hjust = 0.14,\n      margin = margin(10, 0, 5, 0)),\n    plot.title.position = \"panel\",\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(\n      size = 8,\n      family = \"Open Sans\",\n      hjust = 0.195,\n      margin = margin(0, 0, 1, 0)),\n    plot.caption = element_text(\n      size = 6.5,\n      family = \"Open Sans\",\n      hjust = 0.14,\n      color = \"grey50\",\n      margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0)),\n    plot.caption.position = \"panel\")\n\n\n\nAlternative visualization\nThe Economist’s map shows just a narrow time span of the evolution of living standards, and it does not allow to see which areas are better off worldwide either. Since the data provided by UN does contain all this information, I want to produce a chart that convey regional disparities and temporal evolution.\nAdditionally, as the HDI index is also produce separately for men and women, it is possible to compute the difference between them for each country and year (if available). In this way, a measure of the gender gap is generated as HDI male - HDI female, whose evolution in time can also be tracked. In this way, a gender perspective is added to the alternative visualization.\nPreparing data\nThe UN’s dataset is in a wide format, with years added to the name of each variable, having more than 1000 columns.\nIn order to produce a tidy dataset with only the required information, I compute it by joining 3 different sub dataframes (main index, male and female) by country and year.\n\n\nHDI <- HDI %>% rename(ranking_2021 = hdi_rank_2021)\n\np <- HDI %>%\n  select(matches(\"^(hdi)(_)([0-9]+)$\"), iso3, country, ranking_2021, region, hdicode) %>%\n  pivot_longer(contains(\"hdi_\"),\n    names_sep = \"_\",\n    names_to = c(\"hdi\", \"year\"), values_to = \"value\"\n  )\n\n\nf <- HDI %>%\n  select(contains(\"hdi_f\"), country) %>%\n  pivot_longer(contains(\"hdi_\"), names_to = c(\"year\"), values_to = \"hdi_f\") %>%\n  mutate(year = str_remove(year, \"hdi_f_\"))\n\nm <- HDI %>%\n  select(contains(\"hdi_m\"), country) %>%\n  pivot_longer(contains(\"hdi_\"), names_to = c(\"year\"), values_to = \"hdi_m\") %>%\n  mutate(year = str_remove(year, \"hdi_m_\"))\n\nhditotal <- left_join(p, m, by = c(\"year\" = \"year\", \"country\" = \"country\"))\nhditotal <- left_join(hditotal, f, by = c(\"year\" = \"year\", \"country\" = \"country\"))\n\n\nOnce the data is ready, I generate the gender gap variable and convert year to numeric.\nIn addition, I remove the observations related to aggregated areas () and create a Region variable based on the original one used to classify developing regions, where missing values correspond to developed countries.\n\n\nhditotal <- hditotal %>%\n  mutate(\n    f_m_diff = hdi_m - hdi_f,\n    year = as.numeric(year)\n  ) %>%\n  filter(!startsWith(iso3, \"ZZ\")) %>%\n  mutate(Region = case_when(\n    region == \"AS\" ~ \"Arab States\",\n    region == \"EAP\" ~ \"East Asia & Pacific\",\n    region == \"ECA\" ~ \"Europe & Central Asia\",\n    region == \"LAC\" ~ \"Latin America & Caribbean\",\n    region == \"SA\" ~ \"South Asia\",\n    region == \"SSA\" ~ \"Sub-Saharan Africa\",\n    TRUE ~ \"Developed\"))\n\n\nAxes and annotations\nTo start with, I create a vector with the different levels of HDI according to UNDP, which will be used to mark the Y axis.\n\n\nhdi_levels <- c(0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1)\nhdi_text_levels <- c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\", \"Very High\")\n\n\nThe axes are fix in a way that maximize the ink ratio, so I first analyze the range of the variables to be displayed in all available years\n\n\nrange(hditotal$value, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] 0.216 0.962\n\nrange(hditotal$f_m_diff, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n[1] -0.0373798  0.2707924\n\nThe year 1990 is selected to create the static plot. The Y axe starts in 0.2 since is the lowest value achieved by HDI, and maximum 1.\nThe X axis’ limits allow to show the maximum and minimum values of HDI Gender Gap.\n\n\na <- hditotal %>%\n  filter(year == 1990) %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0.2, 1), breaks = hdi_levels) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.08, 0.28), expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  xlab(\"HDI Gender gap\") +\n  ylab(\"Human Development Index (HDI)\")\na\n\n\n\nNotice that countries in which women are better off than men have a negative value, so they will appear on the left size of 0. To highlight this fact, I add a dashed line in 0. I also add dashed lines in each of the levels of HDI to differentiate them clearly. Additionally, I add an annotation showing the corresponding level under the dashed line. To do so, I specify its position just two decimals below the HDI level mark.\n\n\nhdi_pos_levels <- c(0.48, 0.68, 0.78, 0.98)\n\na <- a + geom_hline(yintercept = c(0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(0), linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"grey50\") +\n  annotate(\"text\",\n    y = hdi_pos_levels, x = -0.08,\n    color = \"darkgray\", vjust = 1.3, hjust = 0, size = 3.5,\n    label = hdi_text_levels)\na\n\n\n\nSince I want the background to be blank and other visual details differently, I adjust the elements in theme in accordance.\n\n\na <- a + theme(\n  text = element_text(family = \"Open Sans\"),\n  axis.line.y = element_blank(),\n  axis.line.x = element_line(color = \"gray50\"),\n  axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n  axis.text = element_text(size = 9),\n  axis.title = element_text(size = 9),\n  axis.text.y.left = element_text(margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10)),\n  panel.grid.major.x = element_line(linetype = 1, color = \"grey\", size = 0.05),\n  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n  panel.background = element_blank())\na\n\n\n\nNow, I add the year we are referring to in a new geom_text layer.\n\n\na <- a + geom_text(aes(0.24, 0.9, label = as.factor(year)), size = 8.5, color = \"gray\")\na\n\n\n\nData\nWe are ready to add the data. In order to show the situation of each country in each year, I will generate a scatter plot with using geom_jitter, in which the aesthetics are set as follows:\n- Human Development Index value for the given year mapped to position Y\n- HDI Gender Gap mapped to position X\n- HDI female for the given year mapped to size\n- Development region mapped to color (hue)\n\n\na <- a + geom_jitter(aes(y = value, x = f_m_diff, color = Region, size = hdi_f), alpha = 0.6)\na\n\n\n\nSince I want to adjust the color palette and the elements of the legends, I add scale_color_brewer for the color, and scale_size_area for the bubbles’ size.\nIn them, I set the legends options with guide_legend and make bigger color points and title adjustments.\n\n\na <- a +\n  scale_color_brewer(\n    palette = \"Set1\",\n    guide = guide_legend(\n      title = \"Region\",\n      override.aes = list(size = 5),\n      direction = \"vertical\",\n      title.vjust = 1,\n      title.hjust = 0,\n      title.position = \"top\",\n      order = 2,\n      label.theme = element_text(size = 7))) +\n  scale_size_area(\n    breaks = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.8, 1),\n    guide = guide_legend(\n      title = \"HDI female\",\n      title.vjust = 1,\n      title.hjust = 0.5,\n      title.position = \"top\",\n      direction = \"vertical\",\n      label.position = \"right\",\n      order = 1))\n\na\n\n\n\nAdding title, subtitle and caption\n\n\na <- a + labs(\n  title = \"Human Development Index and Gender gaps\",\n  subtitle = \"Gender gap =  HDI male - HDI female\",\n  caption = \"Source: United Nations\")\na\n\n\n\nFinal static result\nTweaking legend and titles’ details to fix their sizes and background\n\n\na <- a + theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n  plot.caption = element_text(size = 7.5, hjust = 0, color = \"grey50\"),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", size = 9),\n  plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n  plot.caption.position = \"plot\",\n  legend.key = element_blank(),\n  legend.direction = \"v\",\n  legend.title = element_text(size = 8))\na\n\n\n\nFinally, it is worth annotating the countries which are outliers or have interesting positions in the plot. To do so, I select a bunch of countries and save them in a vector. Them, I filter the dataset to get this names along with its data in 1990. Finally, I add a new geom_text\n\n\ncountries <- c(\"Spain\", \"Afghanistan\", \"China\", \"Yemen\", \"India\", \"Niger\", \"Uruguay\")\n\nlabels1990 <- hditotal %>% filter(country %in% countries, year == 1990)\n\na_lab <- a + geom_text(\n  data = labels1990, aes(y = value, x = f_m_diff, label = country),\n  check_overlap = TRUE,\n  size = 3) \n\na_lab\n\n\n\nMoving the wrong direction? 1990 VS 2021\nHaving the chart for 1990 ready, we can reproduce it for different years using %+% to use the whole data set and filtering the desired year. I create the static chart for 2021 like this\n\n\nd <- a %+% (hditotal %>% filter(year == 2021))\n\nlabels2021 <- hditotal %>% filter(country %in% countries, year == 2021)\n\nd_lab <- d + geom_text(\n  data = labels2021, aes(y = value, x = f_m_diff, label = country),\n  check_overlap = TRUE,\n  size = 3)\n\nd_lab\n\n\n\nPlacing both years together, we can see the changes produced in 30 years of evolution:\nMuch more countries in the “Very High” HDI area\nLess Y dispersion: concentrated in the top par, implying higher HDI in general\nLess X dispersion: most countries between 0 an 0.1 HDI gender gap, with some outliers\nMany more countries at the left side of 0, implying better liver standards for women than for men\nLess very small bubbles: in general, HDI female has risen worldwide\nGreat movement up of the two most populated countries (China, India)\nLow HDI area: Sub-Saharan countries + those with highest gender gap in 2021\n\n\na_lab + (d_lab +plot_layout(guides=\"keep\")) + plot_layout(guides=\"collect\")\n\n\n\nAdding motion\nThe main goal of this visualization is to show historical evolution taking advantage of the time series availability in UNDP data.\nTo achieve that, I use plotly to add the variable year as a frame aesthetic used to add animation.\nIn order to have the labels for all years, I do the same than for 1990 but without filtering for 1990. Then, I add the geom_text as before and save it with a new name (b). Additionally, I set scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.08, 0.28)) which replaces the previous one, in which expand was fixed to 0. Now, since plotly does not keep much of the formatting, I allow for more space to keep visible all the elements.\n\n\nall_labels <- hditotal %>% filter(country %in% countries)\n\nb <- a + geom_text(\n  data = all_labels, aes(y = value, x = f_m_diff, label = country),\n  check_overlap = TRUE,\n  size = 3\n) + scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.08, 0.28))  \n\n\nBy using %+% hditotal we switch to use the whole data set\n\n\nggplotly(b %+% hditotal + aes(frame = year),\n  width = 750, height = 550,\n  dynamicTicks = FALSE) \n\n\n\nAnd finally… a GIF\nThe package gganimate also allows us add a different kind of motion. It keeps all formatting much better than ggplotly, showing clearly how regions have evolved over the past 30 years, converging towards higher levels of human development (moving up) and reducing the HDI gender gap (moving to the left).\nAs before, we have to use the whole data set. I create a new object for that (c). We also have to add two more lines specific of this package in which we specify the transition time and the way in which it moves.\n\n\nc <-  b %+% hditotal\n\nc <- c +\n  transition_time(as.integer(year)) +\n  ease_aes(\"linear\")\n\n\nNow we just use animate\n\n\n# sizes fit better with this option in the gif\nshowtext::showtext_opts(dpi=96)\nanimate(c, height = 400, width = 600)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Luis R. Martínez, professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, not only developed a model to calculate the GDP of every country based in the NTL data set, but he also found that countries with less political rights and civil liberties report overestimated GDP. The goal of this article is to rebuild a chart designed by The Economist to show the magnitude of this finding.\nThe Economist’s chartData collection\nThe data includes different records per country: the GDP from World Bank, the GDP estimated based on NTL, and the yearly growth of each one between 2002 and 2021. In addition, it includes the status in the Freedom in the World Index 2021, published by Freedom House, which classifies each country in three categories (Free, Partly Free, and Not Free). Finally, the population is incorporated, because for visualization purposes the chart only shows countries with more than 5 million population. Mr. Martínez provided me the projections of the NTL model, after contacting him by email.\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\nLet’s see how the data looks like:\n\n\nDF <- read.csv(\"economist.csv\")\n\n\n\nCountry.Name\nYear\nGDP. growth.LCU.R\nGDP.in. 2015.USD.R\nGDP.growth.

The X-axis doesn’t include a new variable. We just order the countries from lowest to highest GDP growth. We add 3 facets that correspond to the categories in the Freedom in the World Index, assigning a color to each one.\n\n\nc <- ggplot(DF, aes(x = order, y = GDP.var.NTL, xend = order, \n                    yend = GDP.var.R, color = FIW.Status)) +\n  facet_wrap(~ factor(FIW.Status, levels = c(\"F\", \"PF\", \"NF\")))\n\nc\n\n\n\nData layer\nWe want to draw a vertical dumbbell chart. As a consequence, we specify two sets of coordinates in the Y-axis, one for the GDP-NTL growth, and the other for the GDP-official growth. In order to connect both points, we add a segment that evidences how big is the distance between them. Then, we create a dumbbell per country.\nWe scale the size of each point to show the size of the economy, according to the respective methodology. In the beginning, we create a horizontal reference line where Y is equal to 0, below the data points.\n\n\nc <- c + \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linewidth = 0.25) +\n  geom_segment() +\n  geom_point(aes(xend = order, y = GDP.var.R, size = GDP.in.2015.USD.R/1e+12), \n             shape = 21, fill = \"#C7C5BD\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_point(aes(size = GDP.in.2015.USD.NTL / 1e+12, fill = FIW.Status), \n             shape = 21, color = \"white\") \n\nc\n\n\n\nScales\nWe adjust manually the bubbles colors, according to the freedom categories. However, as we defined a point shape that allows us to specify a border color (# 21), we see that each point has a border color ‘white’ to facilitate the distinction between countries.\nWe adapt the size, to highlight largest economies, but keeping visible the smallest with the help of the range argument. In addition, we define the breaks for the size scale.\nThe Y-axis has breaks for every 50 percentage points in a range between -50 and 450. Note that this axis is placed on the right. Furthermore, the X-axis needs an extra space for annotations.\n\n\nc <- c + scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#FFC259\", \"#F6423C\", \"#FFA9A6\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#FFC259\", \"#F6423C\", \"#FFA9A6\")) +\n  scale_size(range = c(1, 12), breaks = c(0.1, 2, 10), \"GDP in 2021, $trn†\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    position = \"right\",\n    limits = c(-50, 450),\n    n.breaks = 10,\n    expand = expansion(0)\n  ) +\n  lims(x = c(0.5, 46)) \n\nc\n\n\n\nAppereance\nThe Economist’s chart has a minimalist and clean design. We use the correspondent theme provided by the “ggthemes” library, as a base. It is required to include many theme adjustments to conclude the design. As an important piece of the visual aspect, we incorporate the “PT Sans” font type to make the chart more light and stylized.\n\n\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"PT Sans\")\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\n\nWe assign a white background, and remove the divisions between facets, as well as its titles, to integrate the canvas. Observe that we reduce the grid linewidth and change its color, to highlight the dumbbells. Now, the bottom line is not a frame of the chart.\n\n\nc <- c + \n  theme_economist_white() + \n  theme(\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    panel.spacing.x = unit(0, \"cm\"),\n    strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"), \n    strip.text = element_text(color = \"white\"), \n    panel.grid = element_line(color = \"ligthgray\", linewidth = 0.10), \n    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color = \"gray\", linewidth = 0.10),\n  )\n\nc\n\n\n\nWe remove the titles from both axis. Besides, we withdraw texts and ticks from X-axis. On the other hand, we move the legends to the top right position, saving a space for the dumbbell legend. Also we change their color to harmonize the chart. Perceive that now the Y-Axis texts are aligned with the horizontal gridlines.\n\n\nc <- c + theme(\n  axis.title.x = element_blank(), \n  axis.title.y = element_blank(), \n  axis.text.y = element_text(vjust = -0.5, color = \"#2C2E2E\"), \n  axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n  axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n  legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n  legend.position = c(0,0.85),\n  legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n  legend.justification = c(0, 1),\n  legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\"),\n  plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, vjust = -1, \n                              color = \"#454545\", size = 8)\n)\n\nc\n\n\n\nLegend\nWe take out the fill and size legends. But most importantly, we adjust the position of the legend title of the size. What’s more, we create an additional chart to represent the dumbbell legend. Later, we add it to the main chart as an inset.\n\n\nc <- c + guides(color = FALSE, fill = FALSE, \n                size = guide_legend(title.position = \"top\"))\n\nz <- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Satelite-based\\n estimate\"),\n  x = c(3), y = c(5)\n)\n\nv <- data.frame(\n  name = c(\"Reported\"),\n  x = c(3), y = c(7)\n)\n\npinset <- ggplot(z, aes(x, y)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x=3, xend=3, y=5, yend=7), linewidth=0.5) +\n  geom_point(size=2)+\n  geom_point(data=v,size=2, color=\"grey\")+\n  geom_text(aes(label=name), hjust= -0.1, size=4, lineheight = .5) +\n  geom_text(data=v,aes(label=name), hjust= -0.2, size=4) + \n  lims(x = c(2.9, 4), y = c(4.6, 7.3)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Change in GDP, 2002-21, %*\", ) +\n  theme_void() + \n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color=\"white\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color=\"white\"),\n    panel.border = element_rect(colour = \"white\", fill=NA),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.3, size= 12, vjust = 3)\n  )\n\npinset\n\n\n\nAnnotations\nThe chart has 4 annotations types:\nText labels for a group of countries per category, including largest economies.\nCategories titles inside of each facet.\nThe average values per category.\nA brief summary of the average values for autocratic countries.\nThe caption that includes some clarifications about the chart.\nWe add the labels bringing geom_text() into play, and filtering the data set to keep those countries that we need. Note that we separate the 4 largest economies, because we place them with independent coordinates taking into account its bubble size.

For instance, it allows us to identify each of the 103 countries, or it separates clearly the Freedom categories. Nevertheless, we realize that the X-axis is used to create an order among dumbbells, but it doesn’t add more information. Therefore, we propose an alternative visualization that uses this axis to compare GDP values.\nIn our chart, the Y-axis shows the officialy reported GDP growth, while the X-axis illustrates the NTL-based estimate of GDP. As a result, we should expect that each country will be located in the intersection line where Y is equal to X. However, the autocratic countries are far away from this line, as their value of the officialy reported GDP.\n\n\nlineAnnotations <- data.frame(\n  labels = c(\"Countries close to this line have official GDP = NTL GDP \", \n             \"+50 pp Inflation\", \"+100 pp Inflation\", \"+200 pp Inflation\"),\n  GDP.var.R = c(340, 445,445,445),\n  GDP.var.NTL = c(353, 387, 337, 237),\n  FIW.Status = c(\"PF\", \"PF\", \"PF\", \"PF\")\n  )\n\nEcountrieslbl <- data.frame(\n  labels = c(\"Japan\", \"Britain\", \"United States\", \"China\",\"Russia\", \n             \"Turkey\", \"Mexico\", \"Philippines\", \"India\"),\n  FIW.Status = c(\"F\", \"F\", \"F\", \"NF\",\"NF\", \"NF\", \"PF\", \"PF\", \"PF\"),\n  GDP.var.R = c(-5, 10, 30, 390, 83, 179, 50, 135, 228),\n  GDP.var.NTL = c(18, 31, 58, 149, 16, 92, 4, 110, 173)\n  )\n\ncaptiontxt <- paste(\"\\n\",\n  \"*Countries with over 5m people, freedom status in 2021\",\n            \"†In 2021 $ at market exchange rates,\",\n            \"assuming reported 1992 GDP figures are accurate.\",\n            \"'PP' means Percentage Points.\",\n            sep=\" \"\n            )\n\nDF$FIW.Status <- factor(DF$FIW.Status, levels=c(\"F\", \"PF\", \"NF\"))\n\n\n\n\nggplot(DF, aes(GDP.var.NTL, GDP.var.R, fill= FIW.Status)) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype=\"dashed\") +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 50, linetype=2, linewidth=0.1) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 100, linetype=2, linewidth=0.1) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 200, linetype=2, linewidth=0.1) +\n  geom_point(aes(size=GDP.in.2015.USD.NTL/1e+12), shape=21, alpha=0.8) + \n  geom_text(data = DF%>% filter(label == 1 & (Country.Name %in% \n            c(\"Greece\", \"Australia\", \"South Korea\", \"Ghana\",\"Poland\", \n              \"Ireland\", \"Yemen, Rep.\", \"Libya\", \"Rwanda\"))), \n    aes(label = Country.Name), check_overlap = T, hjust = -0.15, vjust=1.3) +\n  geom_text(data = Ecountrieslbl, aes(label=labels), hjust=0) + \n  geom_text(data = lineAnnotations[1,], aes(label = labels), angle = 25.8, \n            fontface=\"bold\", color=\"#44B4C1\") +\n  geom_text(data = lineAnnotations[2:4,], aes(label = labels), \n            angle = 26, fontface=\"bold\", size = 4) +\n  lims(x= c(-50,450)) + \n  scale_size(range = c(1,12), breaks= c(0.1,2,10), \"GDP in 2021, $trn†\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#FEC427\",\"#255D91\", \"#B41D11\"), \n    name= \"Freedom Status\", labels=c(\"Free\", \"Partly Free\", \"Not Free\")) + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(-50, 450), n.breaks=10, expand=expansion(0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-50, 450), n.breaks = 10) +\n  labs(x= \"NTL-estimated GDP\", y=\"Official GDP\") + \n  ggtitle(\"GDP growth, 2002-21, %*\", ) +\n  labs(caption = captiontxt) +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill= \"#F3F0EA\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill= \"#F3F0EA\"),\n    panel.grid = element_line(linetype = 2),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(size = 0.5, colour = \"grey\"),\n    panel.border = element_rect(color = \"#F3F0EA\", fill=NA),\n    axis.title.y =  element_text(color = \"black\"), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(color = \"black\"),\n    legend.position=c(1, 0.01),\n    legend.justification=c(1, 0),\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill=\"#F3F0EA\", color=\"#F3F0EA\"),\n    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color = \"#F3F0EA\"),\n    axis.line.y.left  = element_line(color = \"#F3F0EA\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0, size= 15, vjust = 3),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, color =\"#454545\", size = 8),\n    plot.margin = unit(c(10,5.5,5.5,5.5), 'pt')\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In this article,\nthe authors focus on the differences in the use of social media platforms\nthrough time (from 2012 to 2021), as well as on the differences in use in each\nplatform within different demographic groups in 2021 in the U.S.\nThe platforms under study are: YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest,\nLinkedIn, Snapchat, Twitter, Whatsapp, TikTok, Reddit and Nextdoor. Regarding\nthe demographic groups and divided at the same time in subgroups, we find:\ngender (Men and Women), race/ethnicity (Black, White and Hispanic), age\n(18-19 y/o, 30-49 y/o, 50-64 y/o and 65+ y/o), income (<$30K, $30K-$49,999,\n$50K-$74,999 and $75K+), education (High School or less, Some College,\nCollege+) and place (Urban, Suburban and Rural), as well as the total (that\nfrom now on, we will be considering when talking about this categories).\nThe results are obtained from a survey conducted on 1502 participants.\nI found this publication worth reading since it gives some numbers to analyse\nthe real tendencies in the use of Social Media and, in some cases, disarm some\nunfounded general beliefs regarding this topic (although the scope is obviously\nlimited to one country).\nBut, let’s get visual. The plot I chose from this article is a heatmap that\nrepresents the percentage of people from several socioeconomic groups that\nactually use each platform. Here you can see the original plot:\nOriginal plotI found this plot interesting to work with since this kind of matrix\ndistribution of the elements was slightly different from the graphs we are use to\nplot and since it had many aspects to practice: the text annotation of values\ninside the matrix had different aesthetics (white and bold and black and plain),\nthe facets could be challenging and the font use seemed elaborated.\n\n\n# Load needed libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidytext)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\n\nCollection and data processing\nCollection of data\nFirst, we need to download the raw data file from the original article page (we\nneed to log-in to the PEW RESEARCH CENTER website first to access the dataset\nand the documentation of the methodology). We can find the data .csv file in\nthe documentation in the GitHub folder of this project. Once we have it in our\ndirectory, we can read it and store it in “data”:\n\n\n# Collect and store raw data\ndata <- read.csv(\"./documentation/Jan 25-Feb 8, 2021 - Core Trends Survey - CSV.csv\")\n\n\nCleaning and processing data\nWhen we take a look at the data, we find a total of 89 columns and 1502 rows,\nwhere each observation represents the answers of one participant). The high\namount of columns (apart from being in wide format) is due to the fact that the\ndataset is also shared by other article (‘Mobile Technology and Home Broadband\n2021’).\nTo clean this dataframe, we need to:\nFirst, think what table we need (final output, original plot): Platforms,\ndemographic groups and percentages. Since the percentages are not in the dataset,\nwe need to compute them by using the values of the platforms and the weights\n(explained in the methodology section of the article).\nSelect the variables we need according to our previous conclusions. To\nunderstand which variables are the ones we are looking for and which values\nrepresent what, it is essential that we read carefully the documentation\n(Jan 25-Feb 8, 2021 - Core Trends Survey - Questionnaire.docx):\nSocioeconomic categories: gender, racecmb, hisp, age, educ2, usr, income\nweight: weight\nPlatforms = web1a (Twitter), web1b (Instagram), web1c (Facebook), web1d\n(Snapchat), web1e (YouTube), web1f (Whatsapp), web1g (Pinterest), web1h\n(LinkedIn), web1i (Reddit)\n\nRename platforms columns, pivot longer the platforms and create dummy\nvariables of subgroups when needed.\n\n\nclean_data <- data %>% \n  # Keeping the above mentioned columns of interest:\n  select(contains(\"racec\") | starts_with(\"hisp\") | contains(\"gender\") |\n           contains(\"educ2\") | contains(\"usr\") | contains(\"income\") |\n           contains(\"weight\") | contains(\"web\") | contains(\"age\")) %>% \n  #

In some cases R has changed the names for dealing with white spaces\nand numbers at the beginning (“X18_19”, “HS_or_less”…). Also, we can order\nnow the name of the platforms according to their value for variable “total”\n(descending order):\n\n\n# Change the names of the columns according to the original plot:\ncolnames(clean_data) <- c(\"Platform\", \"Total\", \"Men\", \"Women\", \"White\", \"Black\",\n                      \"Hispanic\", \"Ages 18-29\", \"30-49\", \"50-64\", \"65+\", \"<$30K\",\n                      \"$30K-$49,999\", \"$50K-$74,999\", \"$75K+\", \"HS or less\",\n                      \"Some college\", \"College+\", \"Urban\", \"Suburban\", \"Rural\")\n# We arrange platforms' names by their \"total\" values (descending order)\nclean_data <-clean_data %>%\n  arrange(desc(Total)) %>%\n  column_to_rownames(var=\"Platform\") #Column \"platform\" to row names\n\n\nY axis labels order, padding and pre-faceting\nNow let’s work the Y axis labels. We need to:\nCreate a reference vector. We will create and use a reference vector\nwith the desired order of the labels and with the same padding we will applied\nfor the y labels to order them. Regarding padding, we have to set the width of\neach of the elements in the outcome vector. In this case, since the longest y\naxis label has 12 characters, that will be our width.\nPadding the real y axis labels. Now we have to apply the same padding\nused before so both the reference vector and the y labels are equivalent. This\npadding will avoid the horizontal left justification to be applied only\nindividually by facet instead of in all the facets together.\nOrder the y labels.

For this, we create another\nreference vector (as we did for y axis labels) to order the items in column\n“group”. This vector “categories” will act as the levels (and order) of the\ngroup column.\n\n\n# Another reference vector for ordering \"group\"\ncategories <- c('total', 'gender', 'race', 'age', 'income', 'education', 'place')\n\n\nrepli <- repl +\n  # Faceting\n  facet_grid(factor(repl$data$group,\n                    levels= categories) ~ .,\n             scales=\"free\", space=\"free\") \nrepli\n\n\n\nX axis and legend scale\nFor the legend I used scale_fill_stepsn() for selecting individual colors for\neach discrete ranges of values (percentages).

However, for license\nreasons, I then selected similar Google fonts. In both cases, I had to use a\nmonospace font version (Noto Sans Mono) for a perfect left justification of\nthe y axis text.\nDownload the .ttf files of the correspondent font type, load import it from the\ncorrect path and load them. Then add each font to each label, determining the\n.ttf file path for each face of the font. Finally, render the fonts with\nshowtext_auto().\n\n\nlibrary(extrafont)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(sysfonts)\n\n## Add the font with the corresponding font faces:\n\n#Title font\nfont_add(\"Libre Franklin Black\",\n         regular = \"./fonts/LibreFranklin-Black.ttf\",\n         bold = \"./fonts/LibreFranklin-Black.ttf\")\n\n# Subtitle font\nfont_add(\"Libre Franklin Medium\",\n         regular = \"./fonts/LibreFranklin-MediumItalic.ttf\",\n         italic = \"./fonts/LibreFranklin-MediumItalic.ttf\")\n\n# Y axis text  (monospaced Google font for left justification between facets)\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Noto Sans Mono\")\nfont_add(\"Noto Sans Mono\",\n         regular = \"./fonts/NotoSansMono-Regular.ttf\")\n\n# Geom_text font (values inside matrix), Caption text and and X axis labels\nfont_add(\"Libre Franklin\",\n         regular = \"./fonts/LibreFranklin-Regular.ttf\", # caption and X text\n         bold = \"./fonts/LibreFranklin-SemiBold.ttf\")\n\n# Tag text\nfont_add(\"Libre Franklin Bold\",\n         regular = \"./fonts/LibreFranklin-Bold.ttf\")\n\n## Automatically use showtext to render plots\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\n\nAdd the settings of the theme relative to facets, x/y axis, plot, labs and\nlegend:\n\n\nrepli <- repli+\n  theme(\n    # Labels of the facets (no visible)\n    strip.text=element_blank(),\n    # x and y axis\n    axis.ticks.x= element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.y= element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x.top = element_text(size = 14, color = \"black\",\n                                   margin = margin(10, 10, 10, 10),\n                                   family = \"Libre Franklin\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 15, color = \"black\",\n                               hjust= 0, margin = margin(0,-5,0,0),\n                               family = \"Noto Sans Mono\"),\n    # Plot margins\n    plot.margin = margin(17,4,22,4),\n    #Plot labs\n    plot.title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 22.5,\n                              family = \"Libre Franklin Black\", face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"grey40\", size = 17, lineheight = 0.2,\n                                 family = \"Libre Franklin Medium\",\n                                 face = \"italic\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.caption.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.caption = element_text(color = \"grey30\", size= 14, face=\"bold\",\n                                lineheight = 0.8,\n                                family = \"Libre Franklin\",\n                                hjust = 0, vjust = 0, margin = margin(13,0,0,0)),\n    plot.tag.position = c(0, -0.01),\n    plot.tag = element_text(size = 15, family = \"Libre Franklin Bold\", face = \"bold\",\n                            hjust = 0, vjust = 0, lineheight = 10),\n    # Legend \n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.title=element_blank(),\n    legend.text = element_text(color = \"grey40\", size = 18)\n    \n  )\nrepli\n\n\n\nAlso, set the theme settings for the background, the grid and the legend (more\ngeneral aesthetics):\n\n\nrepli <- repli+\n  theme(\n    # Panel and plot (spacing and grid)\n    panel.spacing=unit(10, \"pt\"),\n    #transparent panel and plot bg\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill='transparent', color=\"white\"), \n    plot.background = element_rect(fill='transparent', color=\"white\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(), #remove major gridlines\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), #remove minor gridlines\n    # Legend\n    legend.background = element_rect(color=\"white\"), # white legend bg\n    legend.box.background = element_rect(color=\"white\"),#no legend panel\n    legend.key.width = unit(48, 'pt'),\n    legend.key.height = unit(12, 'pt'),\n    legend.margin = margin(5, 0, 0, 0)\n  )\nrepli\n\n\n\nAnnotation\nThe annotation of the values inside the matrix is applied using geom_text().\nWhen the values are above or equal to 40(%) the font is in white and in bold,\nwhen they are below, they are in black and in plain text.

Some minor details could be implemented: some\ncolors of the color scale (legend) could have more extreme values to distinguish\nthem better. Also, the labels for the demographic main groups (age, gender,\nincome…) could be added. Optionally, the logos of the platforms could be\ndisplayed above their names since we tend to recognize even faster the social\nmedia app logos than their names.\nApart from this, the main disadvantage of the plot is the difficulty in visually\ndistinguishing the difference in the tendencies within demographic groups. To\nsolve that, we can use a parallel coordinates plot.\nOnce we have read the clean_data.csv file we generated in the replication plot,\nwe create, as before, new column names (these are slightly different from the\nother plot in the case of age, for space reasons). Also, we adjust the\ndata frame for our parallel coordinate plot’s structure: we order according to\ndescending Total values, we create a column “key” from the demographic group\ncolumn names and another column “value” with their values, we filter the\ndata frame and we create a column for “group” (as before). Then, we pivot wider\nthe Platform column into individual columns.\n\n\ndataK <- read.csv(\"clean_data.csv\")\ncolnames(dataK) <- c(\"Platform\", \"Total\", \"Men\", \"Women\", \"White\", \"Black\",\n                      \"Hispanic\", \"18-29\", \"30-49\", \"50-64\", \"65+\", \"<$30K\",\n                      \"$30K-49.9K\", \"$50K-74.9K\", \"$75K+\", \"HS or less\",\n                      \"Some college\", \"College+\", \"Urban\", \"Suburban\", \"Rural\")\n\ndataK <- dataK %>% \n  # Order by descending values of \"Total\"\n  arrange(desc(Total)) %>% \n  # Create two columns: key (demo. subgroups) and value (percentages)\n  gather(\"key\", \"value\", -Platform) %>%\n  # Filter\n  filter(key %in% c(\"Total\", \"Men\", \"Women\", \"White\", \"Black\", \"Hispanic\",\n                    \"18-29\", \"30-49\", \"50-64\", \"65+\",\"<$30K\",\n                    \"$30K-49.9K\", \"$50K-74.9K\", \"$75K+\", \"HS or less\",\n                    \"Some college\", \"College+\", \"Urban\", \"Suburban\", \"Rural\")\n         ) %>%\n  # Create a \"group\" column\n  mutate(group = case_when(\n    key == \"Total\" ~ \"total\",\n    key %in% c(\"Men\", \"Women\") ~ \"gender\",\n    key %in% c(\"White\", \"Black\", \"Hispanic\") ~ \"race\",\n    key %in% c(\"18-29\", \"30-49\", \"50-64\", \"65+\") ~ \"age\",\n    key %in% c(\"<$30K\",\"$30K-49.9K\", \"$50K-74.9K\", \"$75K+\") ~\"income\",\n    key %in% c(\"HS or less\", \"Some college\", \"College+\") ~ \"education\",\n    key %in% c(\"Urban\", \"Suburban\", \"Rural\") ~ \"place\"\n  )) %>% \n  # Pivot wider\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"Platform\",\n              values_from = \"value\"\n              ) \n\n\nBuilding the plots: ggparcoord()\nThe idea is to create individual parallel coordinate plots for each of the\ndemographic groups, using an individual color scale for each one (color-hue\nscales). We will use ggparcoord() for this purpose.\nWe will need to discard the percentage values (geom_text()). Otherwise, we\nwouldn’t be able to properly read them.\nWe will repeat almost the same process: filter data frame by the group,\nbuilding the ggplot (x axis the platforms, y axis the percentages) and\nsetting the line size. In some cases, we will need a reference vector to\norder the variables in the legend.\n\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n\nTotal\n\n\ntotal <- dataK%>%\n  # Filter by group\n  filter(group == \"total\") %>% \n  # Generating the plot\n  ggparcoord(dataK,\n             columns= c(3:13), # Platforms\n             groupColumn = \"key\", # Demographic subgroups\n             showPoints = TRUE,\n             order= c(2:21),\n             scale= \"globalminmax\",\n             title= \"Total\"\n  )+\n  # Line thickness\n  geom_line(size= 1.2)\ntotal\n\n\n\nGender\n\n\ngender <- dataK%>%\n  # Filter by group\n  filter(group == \"gender\") %>% \n  # Generating the plot\n  ggparcoord(dataK,\n             columns= c(3:13), # Platforms\n             groupColumn = \"key\", # Demographic subgroups\n             showPoints = TRUE,\n             order= c(2:21),\n             title= \"Gender\",\n             scale= \"globalminmax\",\n             alphaLines = 0.7\n  )+\n  # Line thickness\n  geom_line(size= 1.2)\ngender\n\n\n\nRace/Ethnicity\n\n\nrace <- dataK%>%\n  filter(group == \"race\") %>% \n  ggparcoord(dataK,\n             columns= c(3:13),\n             groupColumn = \"key\",\n             showPoints = TRUE,\n             order= c(2:21),\n             title= \"Race\",\n             scale= \"globalminmax\",\n             alphaLines = 0.7,\n  )+\n  geom_line(size=1)\nrace\n\n\n\nAge\n\n\nage <- dataK%>%\n  filter(group == \"age\") %>% # Filtering by age\n  ggparcoord(dataK,\n             columns= c(3:13),\n             groupColumn = \"key\",\n             showPoints = TRUE,\n             order= c(2:21),\n             title= \"Age\",\n             scale= \"globalminmax\",\n             alphaLines = 0.7\n  )+\n  geom_line(size=1)\nage\n\n\n\nIncome\n\n\norder_inc <- c(\"<$30K\", \"$30K-49.9K\", \"$50K-74.9K\", \"$75K+\")\nincome <- dataK%>%\n  filter(group == \"income\") %>% # Filtering by income category\n  mutate(key = fct_relevel (key, levels = order_inc)) # Ordering income subgroups\n\nincome <- dataK%>%\n  filter(group == \"income\") %>% \n  mutate(key = fct_relevel (key, levels = order_inc)) %>% \n  ggparcoord(dataK,\n             columns= c(3:13),\n             groupColumn = \"key\",\n             showPoints = TRUE,\n             order= c(2:21),\n             title= \"Income\",\n             scale= \"globalminmax\",\n             alphaLines = 0.7,\n  )+\n  geom_line(size=1)\n\nincome\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\norder_educ <- c(\"HS or less\", \"Some college\", \"College+\") # Ordered levels vector\neducation <- dataK%>%\n  filter(group == \"education\") %>% # Filtering education categories \n  mutate(key = fct_relevel (key, levels = order_educ))  \n  \neducation <- education %>% \n  ggparcoord(dataK,\n             columns= c(3:13),\n             groupColumn = \"key\",\n             showPoints = TRUE,\n             order= c(2:21),\n             title= \"Education\",\n             scale= \"globalminmax\",\n             alphaLines = 0.7,\n  )+\n  geom_line(size=1)\neducation\n\n\n\nPlace\n\n\nplace <- dataK%>%\n  filter(group == \"place\") %>% \n  ggparcoord(dataK,\n             columns= c(3:13),\n             groupColumn = \"key\",\n             showPoints = TRUE,\n             order= c(2:21),\n             title= \"Place\",\n             scale= \"globalminmax\",\n             alphaLines = 0.7,\n  )+\n  geom_line(size=1)\nplace\n\n\n\nColor scales and theme\nAt the beginning I tried to use mostly hue-colors palettes with\nscale_color_discrete_sequential().

Always read carefully all the\ndocuments in the documentation, it’s all there and it shows (or it should do)\nthe reasoning behind the author’s choices. The time invested in reading the\ndocumentation will save you tons of time.\nUse RMarkdown from the beginning, especially if you intend to share your\nproject. Comments in .R are ok (if you remember to add them), but adding\ntext and separate your scripts in chunks gives you a more visually organised\nresult. Plus, using chunks allows you to section your work progress in stages\nand it’s easier to control bugs.\nThere must be always an ending, specially when replicating.\nLeave the fonts and the export size for the last stage (even if it’s hard to\nwatch). Otherwise, you may invest too much time in doing this process\niteratively. And don’t forget to render them before trying the next font of the\nlist.\n\n\n\n",

Specifically, it shows how, systematically, the % of individuals who think that their children will have a worse economic situation than their parents is higher among those who think that the economic situation in their country is bad.\nThis graph, while not overly complicated to replicate, presents some difficulty stemming from the fact that it is actually two graphs in one. The main graph was relatively easy to carry out, except for the legend, which presented a challenge to some degree. To carry out the accompanying one (the table showing the difference between the groups) I had to think a bit out the box. The process of putting them together was the most time-consuming part, mainly because I had no prior knowledge of the library patchwork and not much practice in joining graphs. In any case, I consider that the final result has been satisfactory.\nIn my view, they have chosen an almost perfect graph to tell the story they want to tell, one about differences between groups. Representing each group as a dot and showing their differences in terms of percentage points through horizontal distances (by adding a grey line connecting the dots) makes it easy to observe the degree of these differences within the countries. The order in which the countries are shown (according to the differences between groups, in descending order), helps to visualize the differences between countries. It also uses color to make it easier for the reader to distinguish between the two groups, although the choice of colors is not ideal from my point of view, an idea I will develop later.\nThe graph incorporates a table that allows the differences to be consulted numerically. The appropriateness of this table is debatable, is the information it provides really necessary? The main graph already makes it possible to clearly see the differences within and between countries. In any case, I think that the presentation of this table could be improved, which I will also discuss later.\n\n\np1 <- dataviz_long %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = Proportion, fill = Eco_perception,\n             color = Eco_perception, group = Country, label = Proportion)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"gray45\", size = 1.5, alpha = .2) + \n  geom_point(shape = 21, size = 2.7) +\n  geom_text(vjust = 2.5, nudge_x = 0.15, size = 2.9) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = \"Poland\", y = 19, label = \"Current economic\",\n           size = 2.9, vjust = -3.1, color = \"#657032\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = \"Poland\", y = 19, label = \"situation is good\",\n           size = 2.9, vjust = -1.7, color = \"#657032\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = \"Poland\", y = 63, label = \"Current economic\",\n           size = 2.9, vjust = -3.1, hjust = .3, color = \"#326296\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = \"Poland\", y = 63, label = \"situation is bad\",\n           size = 2.9, vjust = -1.7, hjust = .25,color = \"#326296\") +\n  expand_limits(y = c(0,100),\n                x = c(-.1, 20.5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,100)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = country_order) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#8cb3e6\", \"#d5ddad\")) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#326296\", \"#657032\")) +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = NULL,\n       caption = \"Note: All differences shown are statistically significant. \\nSource: Spring 2022 Global Attitudes Survey.

I have also replaced the green with a brighter green, because the red stood out too much.

The criteria I have followed to carry out this grouping is geographic and cultural. I have grouped different European countries according to the region in which they are located; I have also grouped Anglo-Saxon countries and Asian countries. As for the way of visualizing the data, I have chosen to show the differences through the slope of the line.\n\n\nalt1 <- dataviz_long %>% \n  filter(zone == 1) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = Eco_perception,

Then I will go step by step explaining each of the decisions I took during the replication plot and the alternative plot.\n\n\n#### Libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(gganimate)\n\n\nData cleaning\n\n\n#### Read the Dataset\nspoti<-read_csv(\"spotify-data.csv\", skip = 2,\n                col_names = c(\"Date\",\n                              \"As It Was\",\n                              \"Despechá\",\n                              \"Me Porto Bonito\",\n                              \"Pink Venom\",\n                              \"Quevedo: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 52\",\n                              \"Tití Me Preguntó\"))\n\n\nHere, I noticed that I needed to create the columns of my variable by pivoting the dataframe so I obtain columns for the date, the ranking position and the name of the song:\n\n\n#Pivot long the Song\nspoti <- spoti %>% \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(-Date,\n               names_to = \"Song\",\n               values_to = \"Ranking\")\nspoti\n\n# A tibble: 294 × 3\n   Date   Song                                  Ranking\n   <chr>  <chr>                                   <dbl>\n 1 06-jul As It Was                                   2\n 2 06-jul Despechá                                   NA\n 3 06-jul Me Porto Bonito                             4\n 4 06-jul Pink Venom                                 NA\n 5 06-jul Quevedo: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 52      NA\n 6 06-jul Tití Me Preguntó                            5\n 7 07-jul As It Was                                   2\n 8 07-jul Despechá                                   NA\n 9 07-jul Me Porto Bonito                             4\n10 07-jul Pink Venom                                 NA\n# … with 284 more rows\n\nThen, I wanted the Date column to be date type so it’s easier to handle.\n\n\n#Transform Date column into \"date type\" \nspoti$Date <- paste(spoti$Date, \"2022\",sep=\"-\")\nspoti$Date<-  gsub(\"jul\",07,spoti$Date)\nspoti$Date<-  gsub(\"ago\",08,spoti$Date)\nspoti$Date <- dmy(spoti$Date)\nspoti\n\n# A tibble: 294 × 3\n   Date       Song                                  Ranking\n   <date>     <chr>                                   <dbl>\n 1 2022-07-06 As It Was                                   2\n 2 2022-07-06 Despechá                                   NA\n 3 2022-07-06 Me Porto Bonito                             4\n 4 2022-07-06 Pink Venom                                 NA\n 5 2022-07-06 Quevedo: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 52      NA\n 6 2022-07-06 Tití Me Preguntó                            5\n 7 2022-07-07 As It Was                                   2\n 8 2022-07-07 Despechá                                   NA\n 9 2022-07-07 Me Porto Bonito                             4\n10 2022-07-07 Pink Venom                                 NA\n# … with 284 more rows\n\nAlso, I realized that the font was Roboto, which is in the Google’s font package, so I loaded it as we learnt in the course.\n\n\n#### First theme settings\ntheme_set(theme_minimal()) #Set the minimal theme\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Roboto\") #Adding a google font type\n\n\nReplicating the plot\n\n\np <- ggplot(spoti) +\n  aes(Date, Ranking) + #set x and y axis\n  geom_line(aes(color=Song), size = 1) + #set the visualization mark\n  theme(text = element_text(family=\"Roboto\")) #set the font\np\n\n\n\nTo follow with, I realized that the plot is upside down so I needed to adjust the axis’ scales:\n\n\np <- p +\n  #set the order of y axis guides\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"reverse\", n.breaks = 10) +               \n  scale_x_date(\n    #set the date format of the y tickmarks\n    date_labels = \"%d-%b\",                                               \n    breaks = seq(as.Date(\"2022-07-11\"), as.Date(\"2022-08-25\"), by = 6))\np\n\n\n\nThen I introduced the title and subtitle and set the format for them. To get the code of the specific color, I used this very useful webpage: https://imagecolorpicker.com/. The size was guessed by playing with the code until I got the same format.\n\n\n  p <- p +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Evolución diaria del ránking en Spotify\", \n    subtitle = \"Posición de las seis canciones más escuchadas en la plataforma a nivel mundial\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16.5)) + # Format of titles\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, color = NULL) # Remove the labels from the axis\np\n\n\n\nHere is the tricky part, the theme settings to make this graph look identically as the original one, step by step. I didn’t write the code at once. I added things while I was advancing with the plot and realizing of needed theme features.\n\n\np <- p +\n  # size and color of the axis components\n  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"#a8a8a8\", size = 10), \n        axis.line.y = element_line(size = 0, color = \"#eeeeee\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"#a8a8a8\", size = 10),\n        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(), # remove some grid lines\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n        legend.position=\"none\") #remove the legend\np\n\n\n\nAs I removed the legend, I needed to add information to know which song is represented by each visualization mark. I started trying it with annotations but then figured out that ‘geom_text’ was more simple and easy. Once I got the labels, I only needed to adjust the limits so it fitted:\n\n\n#for the location of the legend annotations\ndf.labs <- spoti %>% \n  filter(Date == \"2022-08-23\") \n\np <- p +\n  geom_text(aes(\n    label=Song, colour = Song), df.labs, hjust=0, nudge_x=0.7) + #Annotations for legend\n  expand_limits(x= as.Date(\"2022-9-1\")) + #Create space for the annotations\n  expand_limits(y= 9) \np\n\n\n\nFinally, I only needed to fit the colors of the original plot.\n\n\np <- p +\n  scale_color_manual(values=c( \n  \"#8dc7ad\", \"#5cb689\", \"#267d59\", \"#54b182\", \"#c71e1d\", \"#4ea07c\"))  \np\n\n\n\nAlternative plot\nAt first, I considered that I could add more information as the color visualization mark was almost not giving information apart of which song is the spanish one. As I didn’t have the resources to get more data from Spotify.\n\n\nspotig <- spoti %>% \n  mutate(\"Genre\" = case_when(\n    endsWith(Song, \"52\") ~ \"Pop\",\n    endsWith(Song, \"As It Was\") ~ \"Pop\",\n    endsWith(Song, \"Pink Venom\") ~ \"K-Pop\",\n    endsWith(Song, \"Me Porto Bonito\") ~ \"Reggaeton/Latino\",\n    endsWith(Song, \"Tití Me Preguntó\") ~ \"Reggaeton/Latino\",\n    endsWith(Song, \"Despechá\") ~ \"Reggaeton/Latino\"\n  ))\nspotig\n\n# A tibble: 294 × 4\n   Date       Song                                  Ranking Genre     \n   <date>     <chr>                                   <dbl> <chr>     \n 1 2022-07-06 As It Was                                   2 Pop       \n 2 2022-07-06 Despechá                                   NA Reggaeton…\n 3 2022-07-06 Me Porto Bonito                             4 Reggaeton…\n 4 2022-07-06 Pink Venom                                 NA K-Pop     \n 5 2022-07-06 Quevedo: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 52      NA Pop       \n 6 2022-07-06 Tití Me Preguntó                            5 Reggaeton…\n 7 2022-07-07 As It Was                                   2 Pop       \n 8 2022-07-07 Despechá                                   NA Reggaeton…\n 9 2022-07-07 Me Porto Bonito                             4 Reggaeton…\n10 2022-07-07 Pink Venom                                 NA K-Pop     \n# … with 284 more rows\n\nCreating an alternative plot that wasn’t like the replication was tough as the best way to visualize a timeline is with a line and the time on the x axis. I decided to use an animation as I realized that the second most common type of timelines were animation with bubbles. Bubbles were okay but I thought that the best visualization mark for the names had to be done with ‘geom_text’ with the name of the song. The time would be represented by each frame of the animation and the Genre by color.\nThe toughest thing to find was how to label the date of each frame until I found the argument ‘frame_time’ between brackets.\nFinally, I wanted the theme to be similar as the last one, so I chose many similar options. Here is the result:\n\n\npa <- ggplot(spotig) +\n  aes(Song, Ranking) +\n  geom_text(aes(color = Genre, label = Song)) + # Assign Genre as the color of the text\n  scale_y_continuous(trans = \"reverse\", n.breaks = 9) +\n  expand_limits(x=c(0, 7)) +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Evolución diaria del ránking en Spotify\", \n    subtitle = \"Evolución de las 6 canciones más escuchadas mundialmente en verano de 2022\",\n    tag = \"Date: \n    {frame_time}\", # To tag the Date variable written\n    x = NULL, y = NULL\n  ) +\n  transition_time(Date) + # Date as the variable represented by the animation \n  ease_aes('linear') + # Make the animation smoother\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10.5, colour = \"#6f6f6f\"),\n    plot.tag.position = c(0.836,0.65),\n    plot.tag = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12, hjust = 0),\n    legend.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12, hjust = 0),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = \"light grey\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank()\n  ) \n\npa\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

They represented the obtained data in several graphs, such as the underrepresentation or overrepresentation of women depending on the profession, with a several gap between the results of the search and the actual proportion of women in each occupation.\nBut the graph we are going to replicate on this project is the one that shows the average position obtained by the first male or female depending on the profession. Such graph is the following:\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Original graph from Pew Research Center\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the replication\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Poppins\", family=\"poppins\")\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Tinos\", family=\"tinos\")\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Arimo\", family=\"arimo\")\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\n\nAfter importing (and installing, if necessary) the libraries needed for this project, the next step is to import the data of the plot. Besides the Pew Research Center didn’t publish the dataset they used to the article alongside it, it’s pretty simple to generate ourselves a dataframe, as they are integers numbers (the position on a search results page) and 20 professions.\n\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  Profession = c(\"CEO\", \"Professor\", \"Electrical engineer\", \"Security guard\",\n                 \"Banker\", \"Clergy\", \"Industrial engineer\", \"Bartender\", \"Musician\",\n                 \"Chef\", \"Movie director\", \"Police\", \"Athlete\", \"Medical scientist\",\n                 \"Physician\", \"Pharmacist\", \"Nurse\", \"Clerk\", \"Customer service rep.\",\n                 \"Housekeeper\"),\n  Male = c(2, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 6),\n  Female = c(16, 13, 10, 8, 9, 8, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2)\n)\n\n\nAs for now, we have the data we want to plot. Let’s focus on generating the plot. Following the original graph, the position of the first male/female that appears on a web search of a certain job is plotted as a tile. The tile is #eb9f2e if it’s a male, #83669f if it’s a female.\n\n\np <- ggplot(df, aes(y=Profession)) + \n  geom_tile(aes(x=Male), fill=\"#eb9f2e\", color = \"#eb9f2e\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) + \n  geom_tile(aes(x=Female), fill=\"#83669f\", color = \"#83669f\", width = 0.35, height =0.7)\n\np\n\n\n\nAt this time, we have one major issue: we only plotted the female/male tiles, but the original graph has another 14 white tiles (or 15, on Pharmacist and Nurse, where both gender have the same value), as they represent all the possible values.\nAdding tiles\nThe way of adding the blank tiles that represent all the possible values was tricky. First of all, my intention was trying to generate them automatically with a given R function, but I was not capable of. Instead, I added to the dataset 16 new variables, one per column, that would fit on the x-axis and be the “empty” tiles. In order from 1 to 16, I added the positions that were left. So the entire and final dataframe resulted on the following:\n\n\ndf <- df %>%\n  mutate(\n    position = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),\n    position2 = c(3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3),\n    position3 = c(4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 5, 5, 4),\n    position4 = c(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 6, 6, 5),\n    position5 = c(6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7),\n    position6 = c(7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8),\n    position7 = c(8, 8, 8, 9, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9),\n    position8 = c(9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 9, 9, 10, 10, 10),\n    position9 = c(10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11),\n    position10 = c(11, 11, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 11, 11, 12, 12, 12),\n    position11 = c(12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13),\n    position12 = c(13, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 13, 13, 14, 14, 14),\n    position13 = c(14, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15),\n    position14 = c(15, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 15, 15, 16, 16, 16),\n    position15 = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 16, 16, NA, NA, NA)\n)\n\n\nPlot again\nDone that, the plot should have now all the needed tiles, both of the gender variable and all the possible positions. So we add to the first code we plotted the geom_tile() for each new variable we added to the dataset, as the following:\n\n\np <- ggplot(df, aes(y=Profession)) + \n  geom_tile(aes(x=Male), fill=\"#eb9f2e\", color = \"#eb9f2e\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) + \n  geom_tile(aes(x=Female), fill=\"#83669f\", color = \"#83669f\", width = 0.35, height =0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position2), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position3), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position4), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position5), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position6), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position7), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position8), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position9), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position10), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position11), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position12), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position13), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position14), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) +\n  geom_tile(aes(x=position15), fill=\"white\", color = \"grey\", width = 0.35, height = 0.7) \n\np\n\n\n\nRearrange y-axis\nThis graph has the essential parts of the original one. Nonetheless, the order of the y-axis is not the same, besides we created the dataframe following, from top to bottom, the graph of the Pew Research Center. To fix that, we can use the function scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(df$Profession). We also use the scale_y_discrete() function to add some space at the top of the grid, as we will needed it for the title and the subtitle:\n\n\np <- p + scale_fill_manual(values=c(position =\"white\",\n                             Male =\"#eb9f2e\",\n                             Female = \"#83669f\")) +\n  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(df$Profession), expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.1))) \n\np\n\n\n\nAesthetic and themes\nNow we have a graph that follows the original one in its factor form, but we have to modify the appearance to achieve a replica.\nFirst of all, they removed the axis title of both y and x-axis. Also, the title and the subtitle and the attribution of the plot, and one important thing: the legend. The legend is added to the graph in a particularly way: Male and Female are not together in a traditional box or something like that, as they are on top of the corresponding first tile. So, instead of using labs or another related function, we insert “Male” and “Female” as an annotation. With the extra space we gave to the top of the grid, the words are not cut by the space of the subtitle.\n\n\np <- p + labs(\n    x = \"\",\n    y = \"\",\n    title = \"Women appear lower in image\\nsearch results for common jobs\\nacross countries\",\n    subtitle = \"\\nAverage position of the first man or woman\\nin image search results for ...\\n \"\n  ) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 2, y = 21, label = \"Male\", size = 3, color = \"#eb9f2e\",\n           fontface = 2, family = \"arimo\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 16, y = 21, label = \"Female\", size = 3, color = \"#83669f\",\n           fontface = 2, family = \"arimo\") \n\np\n\n\n\nThe trickiest thing we tended to solve is the tiles of Pharmacist and Nurse, the only ones where Male and Female have the same value. The closest approach was generating an annotation with a rectangle (instead of a triangle, as it was impossible to achieve):\n\n\np <- p +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 3.05, xmax = 3.2, ymin = 4.725, ymax = 5.3, alpha = 1,\n           color = \"#eb9f2e\", fill = \"#eb9f2e\") +\n  annotate(\"rect\", xmin = 4.05, xmax = 4.2, ymin = 3.725, ymax = 4.3, alpha = 1,\n           color = \"#eb9f2e\", fill = \"#eb9f2e\") \n\np\n\n\n\nFinally, we adjust the things related to the themes. The grid has to be completely white and without borders, the axis ticks and line disappear and we try to have the same font family as the original one, as well of adjusting on the horizontal axis the title and the subtitle. This results in the final graph.\n\n\np <- p + theme_light() +\n  theme(\n  panel.background = element_blank(),\n  panel.grid = element_line(size = 0.25, color = \"white\"),\n  axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n  axis.line = element_blank(),\n  panel.border = element_blank(),\n  axis.text = element_text(family = \"tinos\"),\n  axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n  plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", family = \"arimo\", hjust = 0),\n  plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"grey\", face = \"italic\", family = \"tinos\",\n                               hjust = 0, vjust = 4),\n  plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0),\n  axis.title = element_blank()\n)\n\np\n\n\n\nProblems\nIf we compare the original graph and the replica one, we see three main differences. The first difference is the width of the plot and the distance between the columns of tiles. Through different manners we tried to narrow the grid, but these actions tended to deform the tiles and the graph.\nThe second difference is located at the tiles of Pharmacist and Nurse, where the original one plotted the tiles half #eb9f2e and half #83669f with each color in a triangle. The closest approach was generating an annotation with geom_rect(), as geom_polygon() couldn’t be printed in a annotation, besides several tries.\nThe third difference is the x-axis. While seemed to be an easy way to modify the breaks of the axis in order to show 1, 4, 8, 12 and 16, at the moment we introduced to the code the scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1, 4, 8, 12, 16)) or scale_x_discrete(limits = c(1,16), breaks = c(1, 4, 8, 12, 16)), the x-axis disappears and also some data is not plotted correctly.\nSolving the x-axis\nThe solution I found to solve the problem with the breaks of the x-axis was to expand the bottom of the graph and introducing the labels as regular text with anotate.\n\n\np <- p + expand_limits(y = -1.5) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = -.9, label = \"1st\", size = 3.25, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"tinos\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 4, y = -.9, label = \"4th\", size = 3.25, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"tinos\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 8, y = -.9, label = \"8th\", size = 3.25, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"tinos\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 12, y = -.9, label = \"12th\", size = 3.25, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"tinos\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 16, y = -.9, label = \"16th\", size = 3.25, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"tinos\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 1, y = 0.4, label = \"|\", size = 2, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"arimo\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 4, y = 0.4, label = \"|\", size = 2, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"arimo\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 8, y = 0.4, label = \"|\", size = 2, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"arimo\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 12, y = 0.4, label = \"|\", size = 2, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"arimo\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 16, y = 0.4, label = \"|\", size = 2, color = \"#76777a\",\n           fontface = 1, family = \"arimo\")\np\n\n\n\nAlternative visualization or improvements\nWhen thinking about another ways of plotting the same data while maintaining the essence and the meaning of the graph, the first thing that came to my mind was to plot the searches individually and in a vertically way. The goal is to keep a familiar look and feel to an actual web search engine. The spirit is the same, but instead of tiles, rectangles figures that tend to be similar to the boxes that Google, DuckDuckGo and other search engines use to organize the results.\nThe first step was to recreate the dataset inverting the position of the tiles, as 1 being 16, 2 being 15 and so on, as we want to plot the first positions on top, instead from bottom to top. We also introduced two empty professions, “Blank”, that will help us later in order to clean the view and insert the legend.\n\n\na_df <- data.frame(\n  Profession = c(\"CEO\", \"Professor\", \"Electrical engineer\", \"Security guard\",\n                 \"Banker\", \"Blank\", \"Clergy\", \"Industrial engineer\", \"Bartender\",\n                 \"Musician\", \"Chef\", \"Movie director\", \"Police\", \"Athlete\",\n                 \"Medical scientist\", \"Physician\", \"Blank\", \"Pharmacist\", \"Nurse\",\n                 \"Clerk\", \"Customer service rep.\", \"Housekeeper\"),\n  Male = c(15, 15, 14, 15, 14, NA, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 14, 14, 15, NA, 14, 13, 13, 13, 11),\n  Female = c(1, 4, 8, 9, 7, NA,  9, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, NA, 14, 13, 14, 15, 15),\n  position = c(16, 16, 16, 16, 16, NA, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16, NA, 16, 16, 16, 16, 16),\n  position2 = c(14, 14, 15, 14, 15, NA, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 15, 15, 13, NA, 15, 15, 15, 14, 14),\n  position3 = c(13, 13, 13, 13, 13, NA, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 13, 12, 12, NA, 13, 14, 12, 12, 13),\n  position4 = c(12, 12, 12, 12, 12, NA, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 11, 11, 11, 11, NA, 12, 12, 11, 11, 12),\n  position5 = c(12, 12, 12, 12, 12, NA, 12, 12, 12, 10, 10, 11, 11, 11, 11, 11, NA, 12, 12, 11, 11, 11),\n  position6 = c(11, 11, 11, 11, 11, NA, 11, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, NA, 11, 11, 9, 9, 9),\n  position7 = c(9, 9, 9, 8, 9, NA, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, NA, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8),\n  position8 = c(8, 8, 7, 7, 8, NA, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, NA, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7),\n  position9 = c(7, 7, 6, 6, 6, NA, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, NA, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6),\n  position10 = c(6, 6, 5, 5, 5, NA, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, NA, 6, 6, 5, 5, 5),\n  position11 = c(5, 5, 4, 4, 4, NA, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, NA, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4),\n  position12 = c(4, 3, 3, 3, 3, NA, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, NA, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3),\n  position13 = c(3, 2, 2, 2, 2, NA, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, NA, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2),\n  position14 = c(2, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, NA, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1),\n  position15 = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 1, 1, NA, NA, NA)\n) \n\n\nThe next step is to create dataframes for every graph we want to plot (and join at the last steps). As there are 22 positions (twenty professions and two empty columns), we divide them in 2 different dataframes. We use the entire dataframe we’ve just created and divide it maintaining the positions and adding another column to fix the empty tiles.\n\n\nf_df <- a_df %>% slice(1:(n()-11)) %>% \n

The 25 most populous countries are included in the graph. Our goal: to replicate it as closely as possible.\nSet up and libraries\nAs with any other project, we have to load some the libraries that will be needed to complete the graph.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gganimate)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(showtext)\n\n\nPrerequisites for the graph\nAdapting the database\nFirst, we have to load the data. In this case, it has been directly compiled from the Pew Research Center.\nSome columns are going to be renamed and/or modified to make easier the coding. Also, a new variable is created to give later the colour to the bubbles (geom_point()) via the case_when() function.\n\n\nreligion.df <- read_delim(\"rel.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\nreligion <- religion.df %>% transmute(\n  year = as.integer(`Year `), \n  GRI = GRI, \n  SHI = SHI,\n  Country = Country, \n  Pop = `Population Size `) %>% \n  mutate(\n# The position is numerically defined according to the score in the variables\n  pos = case_when( \n    (GRI < 2.3 & SHI < 1.4) ~ 1, \n    ((GRI >= 2.3 & GRI < 4.5) & SHI < 1.4) ~ 2, \n    ((GRI >= 4.5 & GRI < 6.6) & SHI < 1.4) ~ 3, \n    ((GRI >= 6.6 & GRI < 10)  & SHI < 1.4) ~ 4,\n    ((GRI >= 0 & GRI < 2.3)   & SHI < 3.6) ~ 2,\n    ((GRI >= 2.3 & GRI < 4.5) & SHI < 3.6) ~ 3, \n    ((GRI >= 4.5 & GRI < 6.6) & SHI < 3.6) ~ 4, \n    ((GRI >= 6.6 & GRI < 10)  & SHI < 3.6) ~ 5, \n    ((GRI >= 0 & GRI < 2.3)   & SHI < 7.2) ~ 3,\n    ((GRI >= 2.3 & GRI < 4.5) & SHI < 7.2) ~ 4, \n    ((GRI >= 4.5 & GRI < 6.6) & SHI < 7.2) ~ 5, \n    ((GRI >= 6.6 & GRI < 10)  & SHI < 7.2) ~ 6,\n    ((GRI >= 0 & GRI < 2.3)   & SHI <= 10) ~ 4,\n    ((GRI >= 2.3 & GRI < 4.5) & SHI <= 10) ~ 5, \n    ((GRI >= 4.5 & GRI < 6.6) & SHI <= 10) ~ 6, \n    ((GRI >= 6.6 & GRI < 10)  & SHI <= 10) ~ 7)) %>% \n  mutate(\n    pos = as.factor(pos), \n    Country = as.factor(Country))\n\n\nElements and labels\nAt this preliminary stage, some elements of the graph, such as the breaks, titles and subtitles are defined for the same purpose of making the code easier and more understandable.\nText elements\n\n\ntitle <- paste (\"Restrictions on religion among the 25 most populous countries,\",  \n                \"2007-2020\", sep = \"\\n\")\n\nsubtitle  <- paste ( \n\"Among the 25 most populous countries, India, Egypt, Pakistan, Indonesia and Nigeria had the highest levels of overall restrictions on\", \n\"religion in 2020, while Japan, the United States, Italy, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzania had the fewest restrictions.\", \n\"Click play to see how restrictions have changed in each country since 2007. Read the full report.\", \n\"Year: {closest_state}\", \nsep = \"\\n\") # The phrases have to be written independently and separated with the \\n function. \n\n\nX <- \"Government Restrictions Index (GRI)\"\nY <- \"Social Hostilities Index (SHI)\"\n\ncaption <- paste(\n\"Note, Population data comes from United Nations 2020 population estimates.\", \n\"Source of the original graph: Pew Research Center, 2022\", \nsep = \"\\n\")\n\n\nBreaks and aesthetics\n\n\nbreaks_x <- c(0.1, 1.1, 3.35, 5.55, 8.3, 10)\nbreaks_y <- c(0.1, 1.35, 4.1, 6, 9.9, 10)\n\nlabels_x <- c(\"0\", \"Low\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", \"Very High\", \"10\")\nlabels_y <- c(\"0\", \"Low\", \"Moderate\", \"High\", \"Very High\", \"10\")\n\n\npal <-c(\"#f7f3d7\",\"#f6e9c8\",\"#f4dbbd\",\"#f5c6ac\",\"#f2b0a2\",\"#e89389\",\"#d48379\")\n\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Playfair Display\", family = \"playfair display\")\nshowtext::showtext_auto()  \n\n\nGraph construction\nTechnical features of the graph\nFirst, we include the main aesthetics of the graph; the two variables of the X (GRI) and Y (SHI) axis. The main visual representation is the geom_point(), labelled by country. Sizes depending on population and colour depending on position are also included.\nAt this stage, all the points, regardless of the year are included in the graph.\n\n\np <- ggplot(religion) + \n  aes(GRI, SHI) + \n  geom_point(aes(size = Pop, colour = pos, group = Country)) + \n  scale_size_area(max_size = 20)+\n  geom_text(aes(label=Country), size = 1.6)\np\n\n\n\nLet’s include the scales!\nWith respect to the colour, we have already defined the palette of colour at the beginning of the construction. Then, we only have to mention it in the scale_colour_manual().\nThe graph is also limited between 0 and 10 in both axis, under a continuous scale (scale_x_continuous). We take advantage of using this function by already including the breaks and labels that would define the levels of religious conflicts.\n\n\np <- p + scale_colour_manual(values = pal, l = 20)+\n  scale_x_continuous(   \n    limits =  c(0, 10), \n    expand = c(0, 0), \n    breaks = breaks_x, \n    labels = labels_x)+ \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(0, 10), \n    expand = c(0, 0), \n    breaks = breaks_y, \n    labels = labels_y)\n\np  \n\n\n\nIn the next step we add the text elements that will be included in the graph, from the title to the caption. As they were defined before, we only have to specify them in the labs() function.\n\n\np <- p + labs(\n    title = title,  \n    subtitle = subtitle,\n    caption = caption, \n    x = X, \n    y = Y) \np\n\n\n\nNow that we have all the elements that should be included, we have to customize them and bring some order. With a theme_classic() we can have the axis removed. Only some custom horizontal and vertical lines will be needed. The particular features of each element_text() are specified also at this stage.\n\n\np <- p + theme_classic()+  \n  theme( \n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", \n                              family = \"playfair display\", size = 21),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", \n                              family = \"playfair display\", size = 11),\n    plot.caption =  element_text(hjust = 0, size = 8), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 8), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.45, size = 8), \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6.5), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1.9, size = 6.5), \n    axis.line.x = element_blank(), \n    axis.line.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), \n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank())\n\np \n\n\n\nThe final step in constructing the static graph involves the removal of the the guides providing the legend for different aesthetics. Finally, we include the custom lines (geom_vline() and geom_hline()).\nNow we have the fixed graph built, but we have to include a last aesthetic. The one that will be needed to create the animation: the frame. (one per year).\n\n\np <- p + guides(   \n    size = \"none\", \n    alpha = \"none\", \n    colour = \"none\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(2.3, 4.5, 6.6), alpha = 0.2)+  \n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(1.4, 3.5, 7.2, 10), alpha = 0.2)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, alpha = 0.3)+\n  aes(frame = year) \n\np \n\n\n\nThe Graph(s)\nVisual features and information transmitted\nThe graph consist in a basic scatter plot accounting for the relationship between two variables: GRI and SHI. However, more information is included on it.\nOn the one hand, the size of the geom_points is going to be determined by the population of each country. On the other hand, the colour of the bubble is given by the position in the graph. Each quadrant has its own colour. These combination of factors makes possible that, visually, the amount of religious constraints for each country is rapidly comprehend. The darker the point, the more conflicts related to religion. Technically speaking, it was achieved with the case_when() function at the beginning.\nLastly, we have to include the most important characteristics of the graph. While the interactive part had to be forfeited due to logistical and time constraints, it possesses the animation depicting the evolution in time.\nThis evolutionary feature is provided by GGanimated. Notice how each country change the colour depending on the position within the graph.\n\n\np <- p + transition_states(year) \n\np\n\n\n\nUnachieved features\nApart from the interactivity, there are some issues that could not not be fully replicated:\nThe fonts for the titles are not exactly the same as the original.\nThe spacing between lines is smaller than the original.\nThe orientation of the 0 and the 10 of the Y axis is not the correct. The “very high” label is also wrongly positioned.\nIt was not possible to include the link in the last part of the subtitle.\nInteractive options with plotly\nThe library that may be used to provide interactivity to the graph is Plotly via ggplotly(p). However, some technical issues arise when we include this option:\nFirst, dimensions of the chart can not be properly modelled. Fig.height() and fig.weight do not work the same way. As a consequence, the title and subtitle disappear from the graph, some labels move along the axis, etc.\nMore importantly, when the time animation is included, some geom_points get lost, moving along the chart without sense. Thus, as plotly was not the scope of the work, and due the time that would have to be invested to solve these problems, it was decided to forfeit this version of the graph.\n\n\nfig <- ggplotly(p) %>% \nconfig(displayModeBar = FALSE) %>% \nanimation_slider(currentvalue = {\"year\"}) \nfig\n\n\n\nProposed enhacements\nThe first alternative of the graph involve re-scaling the graph. As the two main variables are measured in the same scale, it would be suitable to have both axis on the same scale.\nTo do that, we only have to do small changes, such as changing the position of the breaks in the Y axis and the sizes of the fonts.\n\n\nbreaks_y1 <- c(0.1, 1.3, 3.7, 6, 9.9, 10)\n\nThe_graph2 <- ggplot(religion) + \n  aes(GRI, SHI) + \n  geom_point(aes(size = Pop, colour = pos, group = Country)) + \n  scale_size_area(max_size = 16)+\n  geom_text(aes(label=Country), size = 1.6)+\n  scale_colour_manual(values = pal, l = 20)+\n  scale_x_continuous(   \n    limits =  c(0, 10), \n    expand = c(0, 0), \n    breaks = breaks_x, \n    labels = labels_x)+ \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(0, 10), \n    expand = c(0, 0), \n    breaks = breaks_y1, \n    labels = labels_y)+\n  labs(\n    title = title,  \n    subtitle = subtitle,\n    caption = caption, \n    x = X, \n    y = Y) +\n  theme_classic()+  \n  theme( \n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", \n                              family = \"playfair display\", size = 12),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", \n                              family = \"playfair display\", size = 6),\n    plot.caption =  element_text(hjust = 0, size = 8), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 8), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.45, size = 8), \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6.5), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1.9, size = 6.5), \n    axis.line.x = element_blank(), \n    axis.line.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), \n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank())+\n  guides(   \n    size = \"none\", \n    alpha = \"none\", \n    colour = \"none\", \n   ) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(2.3, 4.5, 6.6), alpha = 0.2)+  \n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(1.4, 3.5, 7.2, 10), alpha = 0.2)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, alpha = 0.3)+\n  aes(frame = year)\n\n\nFinally, in the chunk options we specify that the height of the graph is the same as the width, to maintain equal proportions.\n\n\nThe_graph2 <- The_graph2 + \n  transition_states(year) \nThe_graph2\n\n\n\nSecond alternative\nAn additional option involves discarding the animated part, and faceting the display in four different graphs. For each facet we would be showing a particular year (2007-2012-2012-2016).\nThe main objective of this alternative is about focusing on the evolution in time of the linear relationship between these variables. Then, we add the regression line via geom_smooth() along with other minor changes in breaks and labels.\n\n\nyears <- c(2007, 2012, 2016, 2020)\n\nreligion_2 <- religion %>% filter(year %in% years)\n\nbreaks_y2 <- c(0.1, 1.35, 5, 6, 9.9, 10)\n\nThe_graph3 <- ggplot(religion_2) + \n  aes(GRI, SHI) + \n  geom_point(aes(size = Pop, colour = pos, group = Country)) + \n  scale_size_area(max_size = 8)+\n  geom_text(aes(label=Country), size = 1)+\n  scale_colour_manual(values = pal, l = 20)+\n  scale_x_continuous(   \n    limits =  c(0, 10), \n    expand = c(0, 0), \n    breaks = breaks_x, \n    labels = labels_x)+ \n  scale_y_continuous(\n    limits = c(0, 10), \n    expand = c(0, 0), \n    breaks = breaks_y2, \n    labels = labels_y)+\n  labs(\n    title = title,  \n    subtitle = \"Years: 07', 12', 16' and 20'\",\n    caption = caption, \n    x = X, \n    y = Y) +\n  theme_classic()+  \n  theme( \n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", \n                              family = \"playfair display\", size = 15),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = \"italic\", \n                              family = \"playfair display\", size = 12),\n    plot.caption =  element_text(hjust = 0, size = 8), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 8), \n    axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.45, size = 8), \n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6.5), \n    axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1.9, size = 7), \n    axis.line.x = element_blank(), \n    axis.line.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), \n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank())+\n  guides(   \n    size = \"none\", \n    alpha = \"none\", \n    colour = \"none\", \n   ) + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(2.3, 4.5, 6.6), alpha = 0.2)+  \n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(1.4, 3.5, 7.2, 10), alpha = 0.2)+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, alpha = 0.3)+ \n  facet_wrap(~year)+\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE, col = \"burlywood\", \n              alpha  = .3, linetype = \"dotted\")\n\n\n\n\nThe_graph3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Figure from un.orgThe Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals is a compilation of statistics from over 200 economies about global development and the quality of people’s lives. The Atlas is a visual guide to the trends, challenges and measurement issues related to each of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are an urgent call for action by all countries in a global partnership. The Atlas was first created in 2017 and since then two more editions have been published, 2018 and 2020. From 2017 to 2020 there has been a big change in the visualization of the data.. Therefore, for this project I have decided to focus on recreating a chart from the first Atlas and improve some elements to better represent the idea that richer countries tend to have higher national poverty lines.\nSustainable Development Goals\n\n1. No poverty\n2. Zero hunger\nEnd poverty in all its forms everywhere\nEnd hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture\n3. Good health and well-being\n4. Quality education\nEnsure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\nEnsure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all\n5. Gender equality\n6. Clean water and sanitation\nAchieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\nEnsure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all\n7. Affordable and clean energy\n8. Decent work and economic growth\nEnsure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all\nPromote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all\n9. Industry, innovation, and infrastructure\n10. Reduced inequalities\nBuild resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation\nReduce inequality within and among countries\n11. Sustainable cities and communities\n12. Responsible consumption and production\nMake cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable\nEnsure sustainable consumption and production patterns\n13. Climate action\n14. Life below water\nTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts by regulating emissions and promoting developments in renewable energy\nConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development\n15. Life on land\n16. Peace, justice and strong institutions\nProtect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss\nPromote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels\n17. Partnership for the goals\n\nStrengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development\n\n\nThe chart I have chosen is from the first SDGs: No poverty. In the section on Reducing poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions, the figure 1c is introduced to represent how richer countries tend to have higher national poverty lines than poorer ones, and in some cases a richer country may even have a higher national poverty rate than a poorer country.\nThe World Bank’s Chart. Figure from worldbank.orgGetting the data\nThe data consist on country observations of national poverty lines and household final consumption expenditure (HFCE). I retrieved the data from the Jolliffe & Beer Prydz (2016) paper on Estimating International Poverty Lines from Comparable National Thresholds. In the Appendix 2: Poverty lines and economic variables, used in main specifications, there is a table with the data required to replicate the chart.\nLibraries\n\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(ggtext) \n\n\nI created the csv file coping the data from the Appendix 2 table. The variables needed to recreate the chart are the following:\n\n\nworld_bank <- read_delim(\n  \"povertyline.csv\", delim = \";\", escape_double = FALSE,\n  col_types = cols(`National poverty line 2011 PPPs` = col_number(),\n                   `Household survey mean 2011 PPPs` = col_number(),\n                   `HFCE (2011 PPPs)` = col_number(),\n                   `GNI (2011 USD, Atlas)` = col_number()),\n  trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 1)\n\n\nworld_bank <-  world_bank %>% \n  janitor::clean_names() %>% \n  select(-c(source_of_national_poverty_rate)) %>% \n  rename(\"country\" = country_territory,\n         \"national_povt_line\" = national_poverty_line_2011_pp_ps,\n         \"household_survey\" = household_survey_mean_2011_pp_ps,\n         \"HFCE\" = hfce_2011_pp_ps,\n         \"GNI\" = gni_2011_usd_atlas) \n\n\n\n\nglimpse(world_bank)\n\nRows: 126\nColumns: 6\n$ country            <chr> \"Zambia\", \"West Bank and Gaza\", \"Vietnam\"…\n$ year               <dbl> 2007, 2009, 2012, 2006, 2011, 2010, 2011,…\n$ national_povt_line <dbl> 1.83, 6.06, 3.35, 6.28, 6.92, 21.70, 21.2…\n$ household_survey   <dbl> 2.66, 10.76, 8.07, 11.63, 23.09, 62.38, 4…\n$ HFCE               <dbl> NA, 9.72, 7.83, 20.99, 30.49, 92.57, 59.1…\n$ GNI                <dbl> 2.62, 5.91, 4.23, 18.59, 32.90, 136.28, 1…\n\n\n\nsummary(world_bank)\n\n   country               year      national_povt_line\n Length:126         Min.   :2001   Min.   : 1.270    \n Class :character   1st Qu.:2009   1st Qu.: 2.203    \n Mode  :character   Median :2011   Median : 4.585    \n                    Mean   :2010   Mean   : 7.872    \n                    3rd Qu.:2011   3rd Qu.: 8.290    \n                    Max.   :2012   Max.   :35.120    \n                                                     \n household_survey       HFCE             GNI        \n Min.   :  1.450   Min.   : 1.220   Min.   :  0.43  \n 1st Qu.:  3.865   1st Qu.: 5.635   1st Qu.:  2.77  \n Median :  9.335   Median :15.880   Median : 11.04  \n Mean   : 22.403   Mean   :22.083   Mean   : 33.57  \n 3rd Qu.: 20.523   3rd Qu.:30.915   3rd Qu.: 35.51  \n Max.   :800.000   Max.   :92.570   Max.   :247.32  \n                   NA's   :11       NA's   :2       \n\nCountry groups\nThe World Bank has an income classification by which it separates countries into four categories based on per capita gross national income (GNI): low-income, lower-middle, upper-middle, and high-income countries. To create the categories, I first calculated the GNI per capita quartile:\n\n\nquantile(world_bank$GNI, na.rm=TRUE)\n\n     0%     25%     50%     75%    100% \n  0.430   2.770  11.040  35.505 247.320 \n\nAfter calculating GNI per capita quartile, I create a new column to group each country in its corresponding category:\n\n\nqntile <-  world_bank %>% \n  mutate(GNI = replace_na(GNI, 0)) %>% \n  mutate(country_class = \n           case_when(GNI <= 2.770  ~ \"Low income\",\n                     GNI > 2.770  & GNI <= 11.040 ~ \"Lower middle income\",\n                     GNI > 11.040 & GNI <= 35.505   ~ \"Upper middle income\",\n                     GNI > 35.505 ~ \"High income\")) \n\n\nqntile %>% group_by(country_class) %>% \n    summarise(country = n_distinct(country)) %>% \n    arrange(desc(country))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  country_class       country\n  <chr>                 <int>\n1 Low income               33\n2 High income              31\n3 Lower middle income      31\n4 Upper middle income      31\n\nDespite grouping the countries following the indications from the article by Jolliffe & Beer Prydz (2016), I obtained a slightly different classification. These differences mean that in my final chart some countries (dots) are colored differently than in the original chart.\nTable 2: International Poverty Lines: Median and mean national lines, by group. Figure from Jolliffe & Beer Prydz (2016)In order to maintain the order in which the categories are shown in the legend I used the function factor:\n\n\nqntile$country_class <- factor(\n  qntile$country_class,levels = c(\"Low income\",\"Lower middle income\",\n                                  \"Upper middle income\", \"High income\"))\n\n\nBuilding the chart\nData\nThe World Bank’s chart is a scatterplot in which each dot represents a country, they are colored by income group. The idea is to create a scatterplot with points that have different colors and fills depending on the value of the country_class variable.\nThe variable country_class will be used to determine the color and fill of the plotted points by using these arguments through aes().\nThe y axis has a blank space as label because in the original it is displayed under the title.\nShape 21 of geom_point allows us to use the outline and fill arguments for the dots, which will be important later on.\nstroke enables us to change the line’s width. I will recreate the dots from the original chart by setting a thick outline and filling the dots in white.\n\n\np<-ggplot(qntile) +\n  aes(x=HFCE, y=national_povt_line, \n      color=country_class,\n      fill=country_class) + \n  ylab(\"\") + \n  xlab(\n    \"Household final consumption expenditure per capita per day, 2000-12 (2011 PPP $)\"\n    ) +\n  geom_point(size=3, shape=21, stroke=3) \np\n\n\n\nScale transformation\nIn the original chart what is plotted is the log of HFCE and the log of the national poverty line. The limit of the x axis is 100 and the limit of the y axis is 40, and the origin is 1. The breaks of both axes are really specific, thus I specified all of them.\n\n\np <- p + scale_y_log10(\n  limits=c(1, 40),\n  expand=expansion(0),\n  breaks=c(1,1.5,2,3,4,5,7,10,15,20,30,40),\n  labels=c(\"1\",\"1.5\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"7\",\"10\",\"15\",\"20\",\"30\",\"40\"))+\n  scale_x_log10(\n    limits = c(1, 100),\n    expand = expansion(0),\n    breaks= c(1,1.5,2,3,4,5,7,10,15,20,30,40,50,70,100),\n    labels = c(\"1\",\"1.5\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"7\",\"10\",\"15\",\"20\",\n               \"30\",\"40\",\"50\",\"70\",\"100\"))\np\n\n\n\nThe other major difference with respect to the distribution and classification of the data is that in my chart the relationship between the national poverty line and HFCE starts lower than in the original. I have not been able to figure out why this happens or how to fix it.\nAxes and panel grid\nAs the theme of the original graph is quite peculiar and very different from R’s aesthetics, I will be changing every element to make it as similar as the original instead of using a complete theme.\nI used the theme function to customize the panel and the axes. After specifying the colors of the panel background and lines, and also removing the lines in between the numbers with element_blank, I specified the style of the axes’ numbers and removed the its ticks.\n\n\np <- p + theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f8f8f8\"), \n        panel.grid.major = element_line(\n          color = \"#dbddde\",size = 0.5,linetype = 1),\n        panel.border = element_rect(\n          fill = \"transparent\",color = \"#d5d7d8\",size = 0.5), \n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        axis.text = element_text(face=\"bold\",\n                                 color=\"#58595b\",size=12),\n        axis.ticks = element_blank())\np\n\n\n\nColor of dots\nThe color of the dots are what made this graph more difficult to recreate. By combining stroke aesthetic with scale_manual, I created a unique scale to specify the World Bank’s aesthetic values. I filled the dots from the Low income and Lower middle income categories in white and those from Upper middle income and High income with its respective color to create the impression that they are solid.\n\n\np <- p +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"Low income\" =\"white\",\n                             \"Lower middle income\" =\"white\",\n                             \"Upper middle income\" =\"#e28e8e\", \n                             \"High income\" = \"#cd1349\")) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values=c(\"Low income\" =\"#58595b\",\n                               \"Lower middle income\" =\"#939598\",\n                               \"Upper middle income\" =\"#e28e8e\", \n                               \"High income\" = \"#cd1349\")) \np\n\n\n\nCountry labels\nWith the function annotate we can add geoms to the plot passed as vectors which is very useful to display the countries’ labels.\nIn the original chart some dots have a label which indicates the country and the reference year in which data was collected. It is not stated why these countries should be highlighted over the others. In addition, in some cases it is not very clear to which dot the label refers to as some are really close to each other. I specified the position of each label with hjust and vjust which control the alignment of the labels.\nHorizontal(hjust) and vertical(vjust) justification have the same parameterisation, either a string (“top”, “middle”, “bottom”, “left”, “center”, “right”) or a number between 0 and 1. Although it is recommended not to use number outside the range (0, 1), in order to recreate the country labeling of the original chart, I used numbers outside the range.\nTop = 1, middle = 0.5, bottom = 0\nLeft = 0, center = 0.5, right = 1\n\n\np <- p + annotate(\"text\",\n  x=c(1.44, 1.9, 1.58, 2.72, 2.76, 5.96, 5.31, 4.4, 3.79, 5.2, 6.48, 9.28,\n        9.47, 13.9,7.96, 13.36, 12.52, 17.91, 29.61, 22.88,16.46,15.88,\n        28.99, 26.12, 31.85, 35.4, 33.95, 29.28, 27.98, 35.52,35.9,46.8,\n        39.98, 49.03, 63.41),\n  y=c(1.27, 1.45, 1.86, 2.1, 2.53, 1.76, 2.75, 3.7, 3.89, 4.46, 5.19,6.43,\n        7.63, 6.32,2.97, 2.14, 2.60, 3.08, 2.82, 3.38, 3.8, 3.87,5.24, 6.06,\n        7.17, 8.01, 9.16, 9.62,11.07, 12.98, 15.69, 18.63,19.37, 20.33, \n        35.12), \n  label=c(\"Malawi (2010)\",\"Mozambique (2009)\",\"Niger (2011)\",\"Togo (2011)\",\n          \"Guinea (2012)\",\"Lesotho (2010)\",\"Cong, Rep.

Because the legend does not have a title or a key I used element_blank to remove them.\n\n\np <- p + theme(legend.text=element_text(size=10),\n        legend.position = c(0.095,0.91), \n        legend.title = element_blank(),  \n        legend.key = element_blank())\np\n\n\n\nBackground\nThe last touch to replicate the original chart is to color the background in light grey with plot.background. To do this, I first use plot.margin to control the margins around the plot. This code sets top margin to 1 cm, the right margin to 4 cm, the bottom margin to 1 cm, and the left margin to 4 cm. Despite setting the caption to the left of the plot, I could not figure put how to align it with the title and the subtitle.\n\n\np <- p + theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1,4,1,4),\"cm\"),\n          plot.background = element_rect(fill=\"#f8f8f8\"),\n          plot.title = element_markdown (hjust =-0.35),\n          plot.subtitle = element_markdown(hjust=-0.25),\n          plot.caption.position = \"plot\",\n          plot.caption = element_markdown(hjust= -0.25))   \np\n\n\n\nFinal chart\nThe World Bank’s chart is trying to represent the relationship between the HFCE and the national poverty line to showcase how richer countries have higher national poverty lines. The visual channels I will focus on to build an alternative chart are the xy position and the hue.\nTo represent this relationship it is important that the dots of the scatterplot inform us about the values of each country and the global pattern. One possible way to deal with overplotting faceting: the same plot is repeated, each time highlighting another group. A nice way to keep the global and the between groups comparisons is to plot the non-group dots in the background and in light grey (general context data).\nMoreover, I have decided to keep the logarithmic transformation because it helps the visualization of the data. It also helps to the representation of the information that the axes are not shown in logarithmic scale, and are rather displayed in the original scale.\nAs in the original graph it was a bit confusing to know precisely which dot the label was referring to, by now having four facets, there is more space to specify each country. To do this I used library(ggrepel).\nIn addition, to enhance the colors of the dots I used the color scheme by Carto to make more visible the different groups.\n\n\nsapply(qntile, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\n\n           country               year national_povt_line \n                 0                  0                  0 \n  household_survey               HFCE                GNI \n                 0                 11                  0 \n     country_class \n                 0 \n\nqntile <- qntile %>% filter(!is.na(HFCE))\n\n\n\n\np1 <- ggplot(qntile, \n             aes(HFCE, national_povt_line, color=country_class, label=country)) + \n  geom_jitter(data = transform(qntile,\n     country_class = NULL), colour = \"grey80\") + \n  geom_point(alpha=0.7) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#5F4690\",\"#38A6A5\", \"#73AF48\", \"#E17C05\"))+\n  facet_grid(~country_class, scales = \"free\") + \n  theme_bw() + \n  labs(title = \"<span style='color: #CC503E;'>1c<span><span style='color: #000000;'> \n  Richer countries tend to have higher national poverty lines<span>\",\n  subtitle=\"Class country\",\n  x = \"Household final consumption expenditure per capita per day, 2000-12 \n  (2011 PPP $)\",\n  y = \"National per capita per day poverty line, 2000–12 (2011 PPP $)\",\n  caption = \"Source: Jolliffe, D.

The Land of the Dragon is usually misunderstood by the Western countries whose vision is usually biased or distorted due to all the contradictory narratives hiding international political dynamics of power. Differently to what many people think, protests are very usual in the People’s Republic. However, due to the lack of transparency it’s not such an easy thing to measure. This is a subject that is worth exploring for those who are interested in gaining a deeper understanding about the controversial economic giant. Studying the trends of the protests in China and the motivations behind them, it is possible to acquire insight about the current state of affairs in the country. Additionally, understanding the role that China’s government plays in responding to and facilitating protests can provide further knowledge about the country’s current political and social environment.\nI will work on the next chart extracted from the article “How common are protests in China?” by The Economist, which aims to represent the different demonstrations of discontent in the country. It is made of two charts which assess popular manifestations geographically and depending on the issue. Scores are calculated using the data supplied by the China Dissent Monitor, a webpage owned by the neo-liberal think thank Freedom House. The data lists one by one all the monitored cases of dissent and different variables including dates, provinces, issues, descriptions, number of participants…\n\n\nStep One: Replication of the chart\nData collection and processing\n\n\n# Load libraries\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n\nAs it was explained, the data has been obtained from the China Dissent monitor, made by the Freedom House. The second data set is a .shp document that allow us to geospatially reproduce the whole map of china, including cities and provinces.\n\n\n# Read data\n\nchinacsv <- read_delim(\"dissent.csv\", delim=\",\", skip=0)\nchina_map <- st_read(\"province.shp\", quiet=TRUE)\n\n\nTo represent the data it’s necessary to first merge both data sets. In order to accomplish that it is necessary to create a similar ID code for each of the provinces.\n\n\nchinacsv <- chinacsv %>%\n  rename(code = province)\n\nchina_map <- china_map %>%\n  mutate(code = sub(\" Sheng\", \"\", NAME_PINGY)) %>%\n  mutate(code = sub(\"Guangxizhuangzu Zizhiqu\", \"Guangxi\", code)) %>%\n  mutate(code = sub(\"Neimenggu Zizhiqu\", \"Inner Mongolia\", code)) %>%\n  mutate(code = sub(\"Xizang Zizhiqu\", \"Tibet\", code)) %>%\n  mutate(code = sub(\"Xinjiangweiwu'erzu Zizhiqu\", \"Xinjiang\", code)) %>%\n  mutate(code = sub(\"Ningxiahuizu Zizhiqu\", \"Ningxia\", code)) %>%\n  filter(NAME_PINGY != \"Taiwan Sheng\")\n\n\nBefore combining both data frames, a few transformations have to be done. First, the “code” column is changed to numeric value and then the “count” function is used to score and group the cases of dissent by province. As a result we have only two columns left related to each object: the province with an ID code assigned to it and the number of cases in each province.\n\n\nchina_dissent <- chinacsv %>%\n  select(code) %>% \n  count(code) \nchina_dissent\n\n# A tibble: 28 × 2\n   code             n\n   <chr>        <int>\n 1 Anhui            9\n 2 Fujian          21\n 3 Gansu            8\n 4 Guangdong       83\n 5 Guangxi         31\n 6 Guizhou          8\n 7 Hainan           8\n 8 Hebei           91\n 9 Heilongjiang    14\n10 Henan           99\n# … with 18 more rows\n\nIt’s time to join both data frames using left_join function. We only keep the code representing the provinces and the geospatial information about each of these provinces.\n\n\njoin_map_data <- china_map %>% \n  left_join(china_dissent, by=\"code\") %>% \n  select(n, geometry)\n\n\nIt is also necessary to modify the data for the second chart. As there are many different variations of each of the issues introduced in the data set we have to group them in wider categories. For example, to represent the variable “Fraud,” we are using “fraud, building quality”, “fraud corruption”…etc.\n\n\nx <- c(\"Others\", \"Corruption\", \"State violence\", \"Fund withdrawal freeze\",\n       \"Land rights\", \"School disputes\", \"Building disputes\", \"Fraud\",\n       \"COVID-19 pandemic policies\", \"Pay and benefits\", \"Delayed housing project\")\n\nchina_data <- chinacsv %>%\n  transmute(\n    Date = `beginning date`,\n    Issue = issue,\n    reason_dissent = case_when(\n      grepl(\"^fraud\", issue) ~ \"Fraud\",\n      grepl(\"^delayed\", issue) ~ \"Delayed housing project\",\n      grepl(\"^pay\", issue) ~ \"Pay and benefits\",\n      grepl(\"^COVID-19\", issue) ~ \"COVID-19 pandemic policies\",\n      grepl(\"^school\", issue) ~ \"School disputes\",\n      grepl(\"^building\", issue) ~ \"Building disputes\",\n      grepl(\"^fund\", issue) ~ \"Fund withdrawal freeze\",\n      grepl(\"^land\", issue) ~ \"Land rights\",\n      grepl(\"^state\", issue) ~ \"State violence\",\n      grepl(\"^corruption\", issue) ~ \"Corruption\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Others\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\nSubsequent changes include creating a new column counting the number of cases for each case of dissent. The column “reason_dissent” is changed into a factor so labels can be ordered when building the plot. It wouldn’t be necessary to use factors if the data had just to be ordered alphabetically or in a descendant/ascendant order. However, the original plot locates the “Others” label in last place even though it’s not the least frequent variable.\n\n\nchina_data_n <- china_data %>% \n  group_by(reason_dissent) %>%\n  count() %>%  \n  transmute(\n      reason_dissent = factor (reason_dissent, levels = x),\n      n_cases= n) %>% \n  drop_na()\nchina_data_n\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 2\n# Groups:   reason_dissent [11]\n   reason_dissent             n_cases\n   <fct>                        <int>\n 1 Building disputes               47\n 2 Corruption                      10\n 3 COVID-19 pandemic policies     162\n 4 Delayed housing project        272\n 5 Fraud                          105\n 6 Fund withdrawal freeze          21\n 7 Land rights                     26\n 8 Others                         144\n 9 Pay and benefits               163\n10 School disputes                 49\n11 State violence                  14\n\nBuilding the plot\nWe start by filling our geom_sf using the values in n, which provides data about the amount of protests by province. We locate the map in the center reducing the background using the “ylim” and “xlim” functions. Borders are changed to white and its thickness can be controlled with “lwd” function.\n\n\nfinal_map <- join_map_data %>% \n  ggplot() +\n    geom_sf(aes(fill=n), color=\"white\",lwd=0.2, )  + \n    coord_sf(ylim=c(-1.7e+06, 2e+06), xlim=(c(-3.3e+06, 2e+06)))\nfinal_map\n\n\n\nThe title and a subtitle are included in this part. We use the R Markdown language to generate two lines in the subtitle. It is a very useful tool in the case it’s necessary to change the color, size or type of letter, however in this case that is not required. To use it correctly we must include element markdown in the theme.\n\n\nfinal_map <- final_map +\n  labs(\n    fill=quote(bold(\"By province\")),\n    title = quote(bold(\"Do you hear the people sing?\")),\n    subtitle =(\"<span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family:Helvetica;'>China, number of protests<\/font><br>\n                <span style='font-size: 9pt; font-family:Helvetica;'> September 1st to December 31th, 2022<\/font>\")\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 12, family=\"Calibri\", hjust=-0.015),\n    plot.subtitle = element_markdown(lineheight=1.5, hjust=-0.01),\n  )\nfinal_map\n\n\n\nOur variable and the scale to represent it is not discrete nor continuous but binned. “Scale_fill_binned” also allow us to change colors and establish breaks for the legend.\n\n\nfinal_map <- final_map +\n    scale_fill_binned(\n        breaks = c(20, 40, 60, 80),\n        low = \"#C7E6FD\", high = \"#004776\", \n        limits=c(0, 100)\n    )\nfinal_map\n\n\n\nThe plot is very minimalist so in both charts we are removing the background, the grids and the ticks and text of the axis. Many different features are modified here to change sizes and type of letters, the position of the legend and the title and spacing between different objects. In this case we are not adding the NAs in the legend because we don’t have any.\n\n\nfinal_map <- final_map + \n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n    legend.text = element_text(size=9, family=\"Helvetica\"),\n    legend.key.height = unit(0.18, 'cm'),\n    legend.key.size = unit(0.6, 'cm'),\n    legend.position = c(0.125,0.89),\n    legend.title = element_text(size=9, family=\"Helvetica\"),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    legend.spacing.x = unit(8.0, 'cm')\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorbar(title.position = \"top\"))\nfinal_map\n\n\n\nThe second plot is an horizontal bar chart which can be build using “geom_col”. The x axis represents the number of issues and the y axis each of those issues.\n\n\nfinal_plot <- china_data_n %>% \n  ggplot() +\n    aes(n_cases, reason_dissent) +\n    geom_col(fill=\"#195B87\", width = 0.45)\nfinal_plot\n\n\n\nIn this step title and caption are added and the labels for the y axis are explicitly named to put “COVID-19 pandemic policies” in bold.\n\n\nfinal_plot <- final_plot +\n  labs(\n    x=NULL,\n    y=NULL,\n    title=quote(bold(\"By reason for dissent\")),\n    caption = (\"Source: Freedom's House China Dissent Monitor\")\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(labels = c(\"Others\",\n                              \"State violence\",\n                              \"Corruption\",\n                              \"Fund withdrawal freeze\",\n                              \"Land rights\",\n                              \"School disputes\",\n                              \"Building disputes\",\n                              expression(bold(\"COVID-19 pandemic policies\")),\n                              \"Fraud\",\n                              \"Pay and benefits\",\n                              \"Delayed housing project\"))\nfinal_plot\n\n\n\nFollowing the minimalist aesthetic, the background and the axis ticks are eliminated; word’s size, type and colour is modified; and the x axis is placed on top. The “aspect.ratio” function allows us to make the plot longer and fit the previous one. The breaks for the x axis are also made explicit with “scale_x_continuous”.\n\n\nfinal_plot <- final_plot +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 9, family=\"Helvetica\"),\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color= \"grey\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    axis.ticks= element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(hjust=0, size=8, family=\"Helvetica\", color=\"black\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size=8, family=\"Helvetica\", color=\"black\"),\n    aspect.ratio = 2.2,\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1.3, size=9, color=\"grey\")\n    ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,50,100,150,200,250), position = \"top\")\nfinal_plot\n\n\n\nIf we compare this plot with the original one made by The Economist we can realize the data doesn’t match accurately. This is because Freedom House eventually updates the data for the graph. It has been attempted to filter earlier dates or reduce the case ID but none of them are giving us the exact same pattern than the one presented. What’s more, filtering until November 22nd gives a much more different output in relation to the original chart than in the present case. Doing a general filtering in the data set does not allow us to replicate the chart, it would be necessary to exclude some cases one by one. However, even though the values are not the exact same, the essential aspects of its visual representation are not really affected and the message is the same. In our case NAs label was not added because all provinces have more than 0 cases.\nIn order to plot the charts together patchworks deformed too much the final result. In our case we are just placing one chart over the next one and adjusting all parameters correctly make them match. This is the final replication:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriticsms to the plot\nI think the main message these two charts plotted together are sending is that China’s regime is not as robust as we usually think. Western imaginary tends to conceive the pros and cons of their political system taking into account two sides of the same coin: On the one had, their lack of political and individual rights in an autocratic environment is negative, while the absence of popular grievances, open public debates and other democratic procedures allows the country to be more efficient and united in order to achieve common goals and an exponential economic growth. However, this plot tell us that political claims and cases of dissent are much more frequent than we think, and these popular demonstrations are widespread all over the country concerning many different issues. I think this charts perfectly accomplish this purpose.\nThe original chart, which has been presented at the beginning, was published by The Economist on November 28th. It is an update of a previous plot which contained less data and was exactly the same visually. Besides this, the only change which was made is putting “Covid-19 pandemic policies” in bold, a change that makes sense taking into account the whole article in which this plot is included, where they explain the undergoing situation in the country. Nevertheless, I think the graph is not informative in this context. Visual representation aims to communicate a message by itself regardless of the information beyond the plot. The Economist wanted to express how numerous anti-lockdown protests were being due to the general questioning of zero-Covid strategy, which has resulted to be an absolute failure. Using a barplot does not seem to be useful to show this huge exponential increase of covid-19 protests, and someone who hasn’t been aware of this political dynamics would not understand why that concrete label is in bold being the 4th issue in the ranking.\nI will propose a modification taking into account this argumentary.\nStep Two: New visualization of the chart\nManaging data\nMy first approach consisted on exploring the best way of showing the difference in cases of Covid-19 between the two plots made by The Economist. Filtering the data I could manage to represent the previous plot (the one which was launched by The Economist but is no longer uploaded) and the current update.\n\n\nchina_data_filter <- chinacsv %>%\n  filter(`Case ID`<669) %>% \n  transmute(\n    Issue = issue,\n    reason_dissent = case_when(\n      grepl(\"^fraud\", issue) ~ \"Fraud\",\n      grepl(\"^delayed\", issue) ~ \"Delayed housing project\",\n      grepl(\"^pay\", issue) ~ \"Pay and benefits\",\n      grepl(\"^COVID-19\", issue) ~ \"COVID-19 pandemic policies\",\n      grepl(\"^school\", issue) ~ \"School disputes\",\n      grepl(\"^building\", issue) ~ \"Building disputes\",\n      grepl(\"^fund\", issue) ~ \"Fund withdrawal freeze\",\n      grepl(\"^land\", issue) ~ \"Land rights\",\n      grepl(\"^state\", issue) ~ \"State violence\",\n      grepl(\"^corruption\", issue) ~ \"Corruption\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Others\" \n    )\n  ) %>% \n  group_by(reason_dissent) %>%\n  count() %>%  \n  transmute(\n        reason_dissent = factor (reason_dissent, levels = x),\n        n_cases= n) %>%\n  arrange(reason_dissent) %>% \n  drop_na()\n\n\nIn this context, the filtered data set and the full one can be merged, each one containing a different amount of cases per issue to be represented.\n\n\ndiff_data <- china_data_n %>% \n  full_join (china_data_filter, by = \"reason_dissent\") %>% \n  transmute(\n    reason_dissent,\n    before = n_cases.y,\n    after = n_cases.x\n  )\ndiff_data\n\n# A tibble: 11 × 3\n# Groups:   reason_dissent [11]\n   reason_dissent             before after\n   <fct>                       <int> <int>\n 1 Building disputes              30    47\n 2 Corruption                      8    10\n 3 COVID-19 pandemic policies     37   162\n 4 Delayed housing project       214   272\n 5 Fraud                          85   105\n 6 Fund withdrawal freeze         21    21\n 7 Land rights                    18    26\n 8 Others                         95   144\n 9 Pay and benefits              109   163\n10 School disputes                38    49\n11 State violence                 13    14\n\nMaking an alternative representation: First attempt\nLollipops seem to be a good way to show the differences between both data sets representing at the same time the absolute values as the previous chart did. In this case, I repeated all geoms twice filtering it the second time to give covid-19 protest a different colour.\n\n\nfinal_plot <- diff_data %>% ggplot() +\n  aes(after, reorder(reason_dissent, after, sum)) +\n  geom_segment(\n              aes(\n                xend=before, yend=reason_dissent), \n                color=\"#195B87\", \n                size=0.7) +\n  geom_segment(\n    aes(xend=before, yend=reason_dissent), \n        color=\"#B10000\", size=1, data = diff_data %>% \n        filter(reason_dissent == \"COVID-19 pandemic policies\")) +\n  geom_point(size=2, color=\"#195B87\") +\n  geom_point(aes(before), size=0.7, color=\"#195B87\") +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(before, reason_dissent), size=1, \n    color=\"#B10000\", data = diff_data %>% \n    filter(reason_dissent == \"COVID-19 pandemic policies\")) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(after, reason_dissent), size=2.3, \n        color=\"#B10000\", data = diff_data %>% \n        filter(reason_dissent == \"COVID-19 pandemic policies\")) +\n  labs(\n    y=NULL,\n    x=NULL,\n    title=quote(bold(\"By reason for dissent\")),\n    caption = (\"Source: Freedom's House China Dissent Monitor\")\n    ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(position = \"top\", breaks = c(0,50,100,150,200,250)) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 11, family=\"Helvetica\"),\n        panel.background = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color= \"grey\"),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        axis.ticks= element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(hjust=0, size=9, family=\"Helvetica\", color=\"black\"),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size=9, family=\"Helvetica\", color=\"black\"),\n        aspect.ratio = 2.5,\n        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 2, size=7, color=\"grey\")\n        )+\n  expand_limits(x=0)\nfinal_plot\n\n\n\nThe result of the two charts merged together look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main problem of this chart is that dates are not shown, but even if they were added it would be quite arbitrary to just represent two dates corresponding to two different releases of The Economist. Also the map above is problematic as the lollipops are representing two absolute values and its difference, but a map can not show all these features and the interpretation can be misleading. What should be added to the map? Only the data concerning the difference? The absolute value of the second date?\nThis is why a second attempt was made, representing this time how the cases for each issue change through time and showing at the same time the exponential covid-19 rise of dissent.\nManaging data II\nIn this case we calculated the cumulative of the protests depending on the dates and the reason for dissent, so we can represent what’s the number of protest each day depending on the issue. As we want to incise in the high number of anti-lock down covid-19 protests we are filtering information after September. Taking a very long time lapse hides this change, so both charts are being filtered.\n\n\nx <- c(\"COVID-19 pandemic policies\", \"Delayed housing project\", \"State violence\",\n       \"Fund withdrawal\", \"Pay and benefits\", \"Building disputes\",\n       \"School disputes\", \"Land rights\", \"Corruption\", \"Fraud\", \"Others\")\n\nchina_data_n <- china_data %>% \n      group_by(reason_dissent,Date) %>%\n      count() %>%\n      filter(Date >=\"2022-09-01\") %>% \n      group_by(reason_dissent) %>% \n      mutate(cumulative_n = cumsum(n)) %>% \n      transmute(\n          reason_dissent = factor (reason_dissent, levels = x),\n          cumulative_n,\n          Date)\nchina_data_n\n\n# A tibble: 214 × 3\n# Groups:   reason_dissent [10]\n   reason_dissent    cumulative_n Date      \n   <fct>                    <int> <date>    \n 1 Building disputes            1 2022-09-03\n 2 Building disputes            3 2022-09-05\n 3 Building disputes            4 2022-09-17\n 4 Building disputes            7 2022-09-18\n 5 Building disputes            8 2022-09-24\n 6 Building disputes            9 2022-09-28\n 7 Building disputes           10 2022-10-02\n 8 Building disputes           12 2022-10-09\n 9 Building disputes           13 2022-10-12\n10 Building disputes           14 2022-10-26\n# … with 204 more rows\n\nMaking an alternative representation: Second attempt\nIn this case it was possible to represent this data using a linear chart, but using a stream in a proportional way seemed to be an even better option to show the rise in covid-19 protests. In this context, “geom_stream” from ggstream package was used.\n\n\nfinal_plot <- ggplot(china_data_n) +\n  aes(Date,cumulative_n) +\n  ggstream::geom_stream(\n      aes(fill=reason_dissent),\n      type=\"proportional\")\nfinal_plot\n\n\n\nIn this part we use titles not just in a descriptive way but trying to help interpretation in terms of the centrality we want covid-19 to have. The map chart is very long, so having the legend at the right is not an option if we want both charts to fit well together. Besides, colours seem to be very confusing.\n\n\nfinal_plot <- final_plot + labs(\n      title=quote(bold(\"Anti-lockdown protests boost due to zero-Covid strategy\")),\n      fill=quote(bold(\"By Issue\")),\n      caption = (\"Source: Freedom's House China Dissent Monitor\"),\n      y = quote(bold(\"Percentage of protests\")))\nfinal_plot\n\n\n\nAs always, the theme is used to adjust many different things. The most challenging aspect here was to adjust all parameters to make both charts fit, as this one looked better horizontally but has to substitute a vertical one.\n\n\ncols <- c(\"#146c9b\", \"#eacbab\", \"#d49c4c\", \"#acdbdb\" , \"#040404\",\"#9c947c\",\n          \"#ce9f5d\", \"#498caa\", \"#546466\", \"#729499\")\n\nfinal_plot <- final_plot +  theme(\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 12, family=\"Calibri\", \n                                margin=margin(0,0,5,0)),\n      panel.background = element_blank(),\n      plot.margin=unit(c(0,0,0,0),\"cm\"),\n      plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n      axis.text.y = element_text(hjust=0, size=11, family=\"Helvetica\", color=\"black\"),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size=11, \n                                 family=\"Helvetica\", color=\"black\"),\n      axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n      aspect.ratio = 0.68,\n      plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1.25, size=10, color=\"grey\"),\n      legend.text = element_text(size=9, family=\"Helvetica\"),\n      legend.key.height = unit(0.27, 'cm'),\n      legend.key.width  = unit(0.27, 'cm'),\n      legend.key.size = unit(0.9, 'cm'),\n      legend.position = \"bottom\",\n      legend.title = element_text(size=9, family=\"Helvetica\"))+\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"months\", date_labels = \"%m-%Y\", expand = c(0.01, 0))+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels= c(\"0%\", \"25%\", \"50%\", \"75%\", \"100%\"), expand = c(0.10, 0))+\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title.position = \"top\"))+\n  scale_fill_manual(values = cols)\nfinal_plot\n\n\n\nAs we can observe, the map also suffered many modifications to fit well the second chart. I think the final result allows a better comprehension of the data as we have included the dimension of transformation of the data over time. This way it’s not just about the different issues and their total frequency but about how the social demands are proportionally changing depending on the matter. In this context, understanding the recent rise of covid-19 protests is also easier to analyze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

To do so, I used grey as baseline, and three\ndifferent colors: green, purple and blue, to show that most of the countries had\nthe same year of data gathering and respondents age, but there are three\ncountries that differ from the rest. That is why I used four different colors,\nto remark that difference, even though using a color hue would have been more\naesthetically pleasing.\nTherefore, this bars color difference and the legend that explains them,\nallowed me to remove text from the graph subtitle and caption. I have\njust kept information about how the data gathering process took place, and moved\nit from the caption to the subtitle, besides, I have kept the graph reference in\nthe caption. Furthermore, the color legend also allowed me to remove the\ndata gathering year from the end of the bars next to the loneliness proportion.\nThus, the enhanced graph has just the concrete percentage of loneliness next\nto the bar, in order to make it clearer and easier to spot and compere that data.\nMoreover, the x axes percentages have been removed because as I have mentioned,\nthe hierarchical position of bars is already informative about how the\nloneliness percentage varies among the different countries. And at the same time,\nthe percentage labels at the end of the bars provide the concrete differences,\ntherefore, there is no need for percentages from 0% to 60% to appear in the x\naxis, because it is repeating information that is already in the graph.\nAlternative visualization of the graph\nThe graph shows a ranking categorical variable, thus, alternative visualizations\nsuch as lollipop chart, a radar chart or a wordcloud where considered, but they\ndid not have any advantage compared to the bar plot.\nHence, as the categorical variables are country names, and 13 out of 15 are\nEurope countries, I decided to plot the Europe map and add the information about\nIsrael and United States as a reference.\nHowever, one of those countries is England and I really struggled to find a\nEurope map data that included England as a country, until I reread the\ndocumentation of the graph and realized they were talking about data gathered in\nUnited Kingdom, besides the fact that the label on the chosen graph to represent\nthis data, was England. Therefore, from now on the territory represented is\nUnited Kingdom and not England.\nChoropleth map\n\n\n#The data\nworldsadness3 <- read_csv(\"map-self-reported-loneliness-older-adults.csv\", \n                          show_col_types = FALSE)  %>% select(-Code)  %>% \n                          rename( Country = Entity)\n#The map\nworld <- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\nEurope <- world[which(world$continent == \"Europe\"),]\n#To join the data frames, map and data\nmapdata<- Europe %>% left_join(worldsadness3, by = c(\"admin\" = \"Country\"))\n#data as map\nmapdata <- st_as_sf(mapdata)\n# Project the map data into a different coordinate system\nmapdata <- st_transform(mapdata, crs = \"+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84\")\n#The graph\n ggplot(mapdata) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill= Sadness),color = \"white\",\n          linetype = 1,\n          lwd = 0.25) +\n  coord_sf(xlim = c(-15,50), ylim = c(35,73), expand = FALSE)+\n#Without grid\n  theme_void()+\n#scale color and legend\n   scale_fill_gradient(low=\"yellow\", high =\"red\", limits = c(20,70), name=NULL,\n                      labels = c(\"30%\",\"40%\", \"50%\",\"60%\"),\n                      breaks = c(30,40,50,60),\n                      guide = guide_colourbar(reverse = TRUE))+\n#now texts content\nlabs(\n     title= \"Percentage of elders \\n feeling sad\",\n     subtitle= \"Other countries: \\n USA 30% \\n Israel 48%\",\n     caption = \"Displayed respondents reported feeling lonely \\\"some of the time\\\",\\n \\\"most of the time\\\", or \\\"almost all the time\\\", contrary to those who \\n reported feeling lonely \\\"rarely\\\", \\\"almost none of the time\\\" or \\\"never\\\"\\n \\n Source: Our World in Data based on Sundström et al.

This journalist explained\nhow in recent years monopolies have increased in the United States despite the\nreluctance of many Americans who consider them a threat to market competition\nand individual freedom. This article is accompanied by a graph showing how the\ncombined market share has changed for the top two companies in many industries.\nThe Monopolization of America\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Source: New York Times\n\n\n\nIn this tutorial I will show how to replicate this data visualization step by\nstep with R and the package ggplot2.\nFirst we have to load the two basic libraries that we will use throughout the\ntutorial: tidyverse and ggplot2\n\n\n# Load libraries:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n1. Read and prepare the data\nSince the chart’s data source was not directly accessible, I created a csv file\nwith the data. This file contains data for three different variables: the type\nof industry, the market share in the year 2000, and the current market share.\nAlso, since in the original graph the positive and negative increases over time\nin the market share are differentiated, I create a new variable (increase)\nwith this information.\n\n\ndata <- read.csv(\"data_graph.csv\", sep = \";\") %>% \n  mutate(increase = market_share_now - market_share_2000,\n         increase2 = case_when(increase > 0 ~ \"positive\",\n                              T ~ \"negative\")) %>%\n  group_by(increase2) %>% \n  arrange(desc(increase))\n\n\nLet’s see how the data is!\n\n\nglimpse(data)\n\nRows: 26\nColumns: 5\nGroups: increase2 [2]\n$ industry          <chr> \"Hardware stores\", \"Shipbuilding\", \"Privat…\n$ market_share_2000 <int> 42, 24, 19, 51, 30, 35, 39, 79, 22, 35, 34…\n$ market_share_now  <int> 84, 62, 55, 82, 61, 61, 60, 99, 41, 52, 49…\n$ increase          <int> 42, 38, 36, 31, 31, 26, 21, 20, 19, 17, 15…\n$ increase2         <chr> \"positive\", \"positive\", \"positive\", \"posit…\n\n\n\nsummary(data)\n\n   industry         market_share_2000 market_share_now\n Length:26          Min.   :19.00     Min.   :23.00   \n Class :character   1st Qu.:31.00     1st Qu.:42.00   \n Mode  :character   Median :38.50     Median :56.50   \n                    Mean   :42.73     Mean   :55.88   \n                    3rd Qu.:51.75     3rd Qu.:62.75   \n                    Max.   :79.00     Max.   :99.00   \n    increase       increase2        \n Min.   :-25.00   Length:26         \n 1st Qu.:  5.50   Class :character  \n Median : 11.50   Mode  :character  \n Mean   : 13.15                     \n 3rd Qu.: 20.75                     \n Max.   : 42.00                     \n\n2. Create the first part of the plot\nThe chosen graph has two distinct parts. The first one shows the evolution of\nthe market share since the early 2000s (2002 to 2007 depending on data\navailability) and the second since 2012. For this reason, I will do the upper\nplot first and then the lower one.\nThe first step, therefore, is to filter the data to use only those that\ncorrespond to the industries included in the first graph. Also, I need to create\na new variable that allows me to order the categorical variable industry from\nthe highest to lowest increase in market share over time (industry_order)\n\n\nupper_plot <- data %>%\n  filter(industry != \"Smartphones\" & industry != \"Social networks\" \n         & industry != \"Cellphone service\") %>% \n  mutate(industry_order = fct_reorder(industry, increase)) \n\n\nCoordinates and axes\nThe graph has Cartesian coordinates, where x is the market share (continuous\nvariable ranging from 0 to 100) and y is the type of industry (categorical\nvariable with 25 different categories). However, in this graph for each y (for\neach industry) we have to plot two points on the x-axis: the market share in the\nearly 2000s and now. But we will see this after in the “Data” section.\n\n\nupper_plot <- upper_plot %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  (aes(x = market_share_2000, \n       y = industry_order))\n\nupper_plot\n\n\n\nAlso, we want the x scale to go from 10% to 100% in steps of 10 and to be at the\ntop of the graph. We achieve all this with the arguments of the\n“scale_x_continuous” function. In the case of the y-axis, we only need to expand\nit slightly at the top to accommodate the labels that need to be entered on the\nchart later.\n\n\nupper_plot <- upper_plot +\n  scale_x_continuous(position = \"top\", \n                     breaks = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100),\n                     limits = c(10, 100),\n                     labels = c(\"10%\", \"20\", \"30\", \"40\", \"50\", \"60\", \"70\", \n                                \"80\", \"90\", \"100\"),\n                     name = NULL,\n                     expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.4, 1.5)))\n\nupper_plot\n\n\n\nLabels\nThe next step is to put the labels we need: the chart title, the subtitle and\nthe tag. For this I use the “labs” function. Later, within the “theme” function,\nI will be able to adjust its characteristics: font size and type, position…\n\n\nupper_plot <- upper_plot +\n    labs(title = \"Dominance of Corporate Behemoths\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\"The combined market share of the two largest companies\",\n       \" in many industries has grown\\n\",\n       \"in recent years, often because of mergers.\"),\n       tag = \"MARKET SHARE:\")\n\nupper_plot\n\n\n\nTheme\nLabel settings\nSince the original graphic uses the “Noto Serif” font, the first thing I do is\ndownload it from Google Fonts\nand install it on my computer. Then I use the function “font_add_google” from\nthe R package “sysfonts” to be able to use it in the graph. Also, in the R\nmarkdown chunk you have to put the following: “fig.showtext= TRUE”.\nNow with the “theme” function I establish the characteristics of the labels that\nI have created before (font size and color, font family, font face…). With the\n“margin” argument I can set the margins (top, bottom, left and right) of each\nlabel. For example, I have added a bottom margin to both the title and the subtitle.\nEven though the “market share” tag now looks like it’s not positioned correctly,\nsince it overlaps the x-axis text, later when I add the margins it will look\nfine.\nOn the other hand, the argument “plot.title.position =”plot” allows both the\ntitle and the subtitle to start at the top corner of the entire plot and not at\nthe beginning of the plot pane.\n\n\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Noto Serif\")\n\nupper_plot <- upper_plot +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n          plot.title = element_text(size = 12, \n                                  face = \"bold\", \n                                  family = \"Noto Serif\", \n                                  margin = margin(0, 0, 5, 0)),\n          plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9.5, \n                                     colour = \"#636363\", \n                                     family = \"Noto Serif\", \n                                     margin = margin(0, 0, 20, 0)),\n          plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n          plot.tag.position = c(0.12, 0.878),\n          plot.tag = element_text(size = 8.7, family = \"sans\", \n                                colour = \"#a7a7a7\"))\n  \nupper_plot\n\n\n\nPanel grid and panel background\nThe next step is to configure the grid and the background panel, also with\narguments inside the “theme” function. I change the type of line and the color of\nthe line with “element_line” function and I set the background of the chart to\nwhite with “element_rect”.\n\n\nupper_plot <- upper_plot +\n    theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = \"dotted\", \n                                            colour = \"#a7a7a7\"),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = \"#c9c9c9\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"))\n        \nupper_plot\n\n\n\nAxis text, axis ticks and margins\nThe last step before finishing the theme of the chart is to adjust the ticks of\neach axis (x and y), the titles of the axes and the margins of the chart.\nIn order to bold the “50” on the x-axis I create a vector inside the function\n“element_line”, with the argument “linewidth”. This type of function is not\nofficially supported, so a “warning” appears. However, it works and it’s the\nonly way I’ve found to do it.\n\n\nupper_plot <- upper_plot +\n    theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_line(colour = \"#c9c9c9\", \n                                    linewidth = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.8,\n                                                  0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.4)),\n        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0.2, \"cm\"),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, family = \"sans\", \n                                   hjust = 0, vjust = 0.5),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9, family = \"sans\", \n                                   colour = \"#a7a7a7\",\n                                   face = c('plain', 'plain', 'plain', \n                                            'plain', 'bold', 'plain', \n                                            'plain', 'plain', 'plain', 'plain')),\n        plot.margin = margin(0, 1.7, 0, 0, \"cm\"))\n  \nupper_plot\n\n\n\nData\nNow is the time to put the data on the chart. To plot the arrows from the 2000’s\nmarket share data to now I use “geom_segment”. In this type of geom you have to\ngive it 4 aesthetics (x, xend, y, y-end). In addition, you can configure the type\nof line (an arrow in this case) and the color, which in this graph depends on\nwhether the increase is positive or negative (variable increase2 created\npreviously). Then, with the “scale_color_manual” function, the colors associated\nwith each category of this variable are set.\nLastly, I’ve also added a thicker vertical line highlighting the 50, using the\n“geom_vline” function.\n\n\nupper_plot <- upper_plot +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 50, color = \"gray\", linewidth = 0.8) + \n  geom_segment(aes(x = market_share_2000, \n                   xend = market_share_now, \n                   y = industry_order, \n                   yend = industry_order, \n                   color = increase2), \n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, \"cm\"), \n                             type = \"closed\"), linewidth = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#575757\", \"#DB3B27\"))\n\nupper_plot\n\n\n\nAnnotations\nFinally, to finish the first graph, we must add the two annotations. To do this,\nI have used the “annotate” function, using the x and y arguments to get the\nproper final position within the plot area.\n\n\nupper_plot <- upper_plot +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 34.8, y = 23.9, label = \"Early 2000s\", \n           size = 3, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 86.2, y = 23.9, label = \"Now\", \n           size = 3, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 42, y = 23.4, label = \"|\", \n           size = 3.2, fontface = \"bold\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 84, y = 23.4, label = \"|\", \n           size = 3.2, fontface = \"bold\")\n\nupper_plot\n\n\n\n3. Create the second part of the plot\nTo make the second part of the graphic I have used a very similar code. I have\nfiltered the data to keep only the three industries starting in 2012.\nIn addition, I have removed the title, put a different subtitle and added a\ncaption with the argument “caption” inside the “theme” function.\n\n\nlibrary(grid)\n\nbottom_plot <- data %>%\n  filter(industry == \"Smartphones\" | industry == \"Social networks\" | \n           industry == \"Cellphone service\") %>% \n  mutate(industry = case_when(industry %in% c(\"Cellphone service\") ~ \n                                \"Cellphone service  \",\n                              T ~ industry),\n         industry_order = fct_reorder(industry, increase)) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 50, color = \"gray\", size = 0.8) +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = market_share_2000, \n                   xend = market_share_now, \n                   y = industry_order, yend = industry_order, \n                   color = increase2), \n               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.15, \"cm\"), \n                             type = \"closed\"), size = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#DB3B27\")) +\n  scale_x_continuous(position = \"bottom\", \n                     breaks = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100),\n                     limits = c(10, 100),\n                     labels = c(\"10%\", \"20\", \"30\", \"40\", \"50\", \n                                \"60\", \"70\", \"80\", \"90\", \"100\"),\n                     name = NULL,\n                     expand = c(0, 0)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 0.8))) +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Technology companies since 2012\",\n       caption = paste0('By The New York Times | Source: IbisWorld and Open',\n       'Markets Institute; \"Early 2000s\" ranges\\n', 'from 2002 to 2007',\n       'depending on data availability')) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9.5, family = \"Noto Serif\", \n                                     face = \"bold\", margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0)),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 9, colour = \"#636363\", \n                                    family = \"Noto Serif\", \n                                    hjust = 0, margin = margin(20, 0, 0, 0)),\n        plot.caption.position = \"plot\",\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = \"dotted\", \n                                          colour = \"#a7a7a7\"),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = \"#c9c9c9\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_line(colour = \"#c9c9c9\", \n                                    size = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.8, \n                                             0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.3)),\n        axis.ticks.length.x = unit(0.2, \"cm\"),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, family = \"sans\", \n                                   hjust = 0, vjust = 0.5),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9, family = \"sans\", \n                                   colour = \"#a7a7a7\",\n                                   face = c('plain', 'plain', 'plain', \n                                            'plain', 'bold',\n                                            'plain', 'plain', 'plain', \n                                            'plain', 'plain')),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n        plot.margin = margin(0, 1.7, 0, 0, \"cm\")) +\n  annotation_custom(grob = textGrob(label = \"Now\", \n                                    gp = gpar(fontsize = 8.5, fontface = \"bold\", \n                                              fontfamily = \"sans\")),\n                    ymin = 3, xmin = 94.3) +\n  annotation_custom(grob = textGrob(label = \"2012\", \n                                    gp = gpar(fontsize = 8.5, fontface = \"bold\", \n                                              fontfamily = \"sans\")),\n                    ymin = 3, xmin = 52) \n\nbottom_plot\n\n\n\n4. Arranging plots\nNow I am going to show the two plots created previously to see the replication\nof the graph from the New York Times. To join the two graphics I have used the\npatchwork library, specifying that I want them in a single column, with a space\nbetween both graphics and with different heights. All this is configured with\nthe “plot_layout” function.\n\n\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\nupper_plot + plot_spacer() + bottom_plot +\n  plot_layout(ncol = 1,\n              heights = c(11.5, 0.35, 1.5))\n\n\n\nLimitations of the replication of the graph\nThe replication of the plot, created with the R package ggplot2, is very close\nto the original plot. There is a detail that I have not been able to replicate\nexactly. In the lower chart annotations (“2012” and “Now”) I had to expand the\ny-axis to fit them, as they were above the last industry category. Expanding\nthis axis with the “expand” argument of the “scale_y_discrete” function also\nexpanded the grid major x lines. In the original chart, however, these lines do\nnot go as far as the x-axis ticks, but intersect at the first category of the\nindustry variable. For that reason I have also put them closer to the arrow\nthan in the original graph and I have not had to put a line joining the arrow\nwith the annotation (with the geom_segment function).\nChart evaluation based on data visualization theory\nGiven the data the graph represents and the content of the New York Times\narticle it is a good graph. This is a chart called a “lollipop chart” which\nconsists, in short, of a bar chart in which the bar is a line and the end of the\nline is a point (a triangle in this case since they are arrows). Unlike typical\nbar charts, in this chart the bars (or lines) do not start at the same point on\nthe x-axis.\nAt first glance, the colors and size of the arrows already make clear the\nincrease in market share in the vast majority of industries. Positioning on a\ncommon scale is the most effective visual communication channel together with\nthe length, so the choice of this type of representation is a wise one and they\nhave used this highest ranked channels for the most relevant information of the\nplot (the change of the market share and the comparison between industries).\nIn addition, adding the shape of an arrow makes it possible to identify whether\nit is an increase or a decrease in market share. The choice of two colors to\nrepresent the positive and negative values in the difference between years is\nalso very useful as the hue color is a very effective identification channel. It\nis true that it is striking that the positive values are represented in red,\nsocially related to the negative values. However, this may be related to the\ncontent of the article, which seeks to highlight this growth in market share (as\nopposed to the gray assigned to the negative values) and which, in a way, sees\nthis growth as something negative for society.\nAnother positive element to highlight is the order of the industries on the\ny-axis, placed from highest to lowest market share growth. The authors of the\ngraph have also decided to highlight the line on the x-axis that marks 50% of\nthe market share, allowing the observer to identify more quickly which\nindustries have reached a market share above this figure.\nAs for the titles of the axes, the authors have decided to eliminate the y-axis\ntitle since it is easy to know from the labels of each industry which variable\nis represented. The x-axis title is also correctly represented, since it is\nplaced before the first tick, to which they add the “%” symbol so that the\nreader knows what the scale on which it is measured looks like. As soon as you\nlook down at the subtitle, you know that the x-axis measures the market share,\nwhich starts at 10 and is measured as a percentage.\nFinally, the chart has a brief but clear title, which lets the reader know what\nhe or she will find in the chart. The subtitle is also very useful because it\nexpands on the information given in the title, explaining that the graph\nrepresents the market share of two large companies. It also gives a brief\nanalysis to the reader, saying that this share has grown and that it may be a\nconsequence of the mergers. It also adds a second title to help the reader\nunderstand what the second part of the graph is about and a brief, explanatory\ncaption.\nSecond step: create a new visualization with the same data\nIn this section I will explain the process of creating an alternative\nvisualization of the New York Times chart with the same data.\nSince the data to be represented contains one categorical variable (with a large\nnumber of categories) and two continuous variables (ranging from 0 to 100) a bar\nchart is a good idea to represent them. However, as I have explained in the\nprevious section, the original graph is, de facto, a bar chart (with slight\nmodifications of the traditional ones).\nAt first I thought of making a bar chart in which to represent only the\ndifference between the market share of each industry in the early 2000s and now.\nHowever, I think that relevant information would be lost (where was the market\nshare before and now). I also thought about the possibility of making a grouped\nbar chart like these from R Graph Gallery,\nrepresenting on the x or y axis each industry, and on the other axis a bar for\nthe market share in the 2000’s and another for the current market share (each\nwith a different color). However, since the data consists of 25 different\nindustries (50 bars in total) I thought it would be unattractive and difficult\nto understand.\nI finally decided on the option of making a graph of parallel coordinates.\nNormally, in this type of graphs, time series are not represented, but a set of\nvariables are placed on the x-axis and a y-axis (a vertical line) is graphed for\neach variable. According to graphic perception theory, this type of graphic\nwould be slightly less visually effective than the one created by the New York\nTimes. This is because angles are less effective in conveying visual information\nthan position on a common scale (as in the original graphic) and length. However,\nI think it’s also a good way to represent this data in a different way.\nIn this case I have represented the variable industry on the y axis and on\nthe x axis I have made two parallel lines with the data related to the market\nshare of the 2000s and today. Subsequently, I have joined the points between the\ntwo lines of the x axis with a line. Also, I have set two colors in the\naesthetics of the segments: green when the increment is positive and red when it\nis negative. In the case of the green ones, I have put a slightly higher alpha\nin those increases that exceed 40% (value in which the average of the increases\nis), in order to highlight them in the graph. I have decided to put these colors\nbecause we socially associate green with positive or increase and red with\nnegative or decrease.\nOn the other hand, I have labeled the type of industries that exceed that 40%,\nsince labeling all of them was impossible due to overlapping problems. For those\nreaders who want to expand the information, I have added interactivity in such a\nway that if you put the mouse over the lines you can see what type of industry\nit is and the percentage of increase.\nInstead of making two graphs to represent the technology industries starting in\n2012, I have decided to include them by highlighting them with a yellow dot and\na label explaining the difference with the rest of the lines. I thought it\nconvenient to do so in order to be able to compare at a glance the percentage of\ncurrent market share of these industries with that of the rest of the industries.\nFinally, I have kept the same original title, which I think is concise and\nexplicit, and slightly changed the subtitle to highlight information about\nthose industries that have grown proportionally the most.\nNow I will show the code and the steps to follow to create this new\nvisualization!\nPrepare the data\nThe first step is to prepare the data. For this I have created two different\ndata frames. In the first, taking the original dataset, I have created four new\nvariables:\nperc_increase, which is the percentage increase in market share between the\ntwo years.\nperc_increase_label, to add a “+” to the previous variable in case the\nvalue is positive.\nincrease2, with three categories to differentiate positive increases below\n40%, positive increases above 40% and negative.\nindustry_labels, keeps the industry label only in case the percentage\nincrease is greater than 40%.\nThe second data frame contains the market share data for the three technology\nindustries starting in 2012 and an additional column with a 1. This data frame\nwill serve to draw the three dots that indicate that these data are slightly\ndifferent from the rest.\n\n\n# First data frame:\n\nalternative_plot_data <- data %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(perc_increase = round(increase/market_share_2000*100, 1),\n         perc_increase_label = case_when(perc_increase > 0 ~ \n                                           paste0(\"+\", perc_increase),\n                       T ~ as.character(perc_increase)),\n         increase2 = case_when(perc_increase > mean(perc_increase) ~ \n                                 \"high_increase\",\n                               T ~ increase2),\n         industry_labels = case_when(increase2 != \"high_increase\" ~ \"\",\n                              T ~ industry),\n         \"Early 2000s\" = 1,\n         Now = 2) %>% \n  arrange(desc(increase2))\n\nhead(alternative_plot_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n  industry     marke…¹ marke…² incre…³ incre…⁴ perc_…⁵ perc_…⁶ indus…⁷\n  <chr>          <int>   <int>   <int> <chr>     <dbl> <chr>   <chr>  \n1 Smartphones       79      99      20 positi…    25.3 +25.3   \"\"     \n2 Sanitary pa…      53      63      10 positi…    18.9 +18.9   \"\"     \n3 Truck and b…      52      62      10 positi…    19.2 +19.2   \"\"     \n4 Railroads         49      58       9 positi…    18.4 +18.4   \"\"     \n5 Amusement p…      60      69       9 positi…    15   +15     \"\"     \n6 Credit cards      26      35       9 positi…    34.6 +34.6   \"\"     \n# … with 2 more variables: `Early 2000s` <dbl>, Now <dbl>, and\n#   abbreviated variable names ¹​market_share_2000, ²​market_share_now,\n#   ³​increase, ⁴​increase2, ⁵​perc_increase, ⁶​perc_increase_label,\n#   ⁷​industry_labels\n\n\n\n# Second data frame:\n\ndata.frame.points <- data %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  filter(industry == \"Smartphones\" | industry == \"Social networks\" \n         | industry == \"Cellphone service\") %>% \n  select(market_share_2000, industry) %>% \n  mutate(x = 1)\n\nhead(data.frame.points)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  market_share_2000 industry              x\n              <int> <chr>             <dbl>\n1                79 Smartphones           1\n2                75 Social networks       1\n3                65 Cellphone service     1\n\nCreate the static graph\nData, coordinates and axes\nParallel coordinate plots can be easily created with the ggplot2 extension\n“ggally”, as explained here.\nHowever, in this case I have had to do it with a combination of geom_segment and\n“geom_vline” because the ggally functions don’t support interactivity with either\nggplotly or ggiraph. The function used from the ggiraph package is called\n“geom_segment_interactive”.\nWith “geom_vline” I have created the two vertical and parallel lines where the\nvalues of the market share in 2012 and currently are represented.\nSubsequently, with the geom_segment function I have created the lines that join\nthe values between one date and another.\nIn the geom_segment aesthetic I have specified that I want the color and alpha\nto be associated with the previously created variable increase2 that\ndifferentiates between positive, negative and positive values above 40%\nincrement. To set the values of both aesthetics I have used the\n“scale_color_manual” and “scale_alpha_manual” functions.\n\n\nlibrary(ggiraph)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Catamaran\", family = \"catamaran\")\n\nalternative_plot <- alternative_plot_data %>% \n  ggplot() + \n  geom_segment_interactive(aes(x = `Early 2000s`, xend = Now, \n                               y = market_share_2000, yend = market_share_now, \n                               col = increase2,\n                               alpha = increase2,\n                               tooltip = paste0(industry, \" \", \n                                                perc_increase_label, \"%\"),\n                               data_id = industry), \n               size = 0.71, show.legend = F) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, size = 0.5, color = \"gray\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, size = 0.5, color = \"gray\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#006400\", \"#d3101e\", \"#006400\")) +\n  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0.9, 0.6, 0.5)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100),\n                     limits = c(15, 100),\n                     labels = c(\"20\", \"30\", \"40\", \"50\", \n                                \"60\", \"70\", \"80\", \"90\", \"100%\"),\n                     name = \"Market share\",\n                     expand = c(0,0)) +\n  scale_x_discrete(name = \"Now\", position = \"top\", \n                   expand = expansion(add = c(0.02, 0.32))) \n\nalternative_plot\n\n\n\nTheme and labels\nWith the “labs” function I have created the title, the subtitle, the tag, and\nthe caption. I used the “tag” argument to create the “Early 2000s” tag because\nunlike the “annotation” function it allowed me to place it outside the chart\narea without expanding the grid lines. In order to create the parallel label\n“Now” that names the second vertical line, I have used the title of the x axis\nitself.\nWith the “theme” function I have configured all these labs and I have\nestablished a very minimalist theme, with dotted grid lines of the y-axis and a\nwhite background. I also wanted to highlight the “50” of the “y” scale by\nputting it in bold.\nTo put the industry type labels at the end of each line I have used the\n“geom_label_repel” function, thus making sure that they do not overlap each\nother. With the “direction” argument I have specified that in case of\noverlapping I wanted them to move in the y axis, never in the x axis, in such a\nway that they would be aligned.\n\n\nalternative_plot <- alternative_plot +\n  labs(title = \"Dominance of Corporate Behemoths\",\n       subtitle = paste0('The combined market share of the two largest ', \n                         'companies in many industries\\n','has grown in recent', \n                         ' years, often more than 40%.'),\n       tag = c(\"Early 2000s\", \"Now\"),\n       caption = paste0('By Isabel Molero López | Source: New York Times; \"Early 2000s \"',\n       'ranges from 2002 to 2007.\\n', 'Lines that begin with a yellow dot ', \n       'correspond to the data of technology companies since 2012.')) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 13.5, face = \"bold\", family = \"catamaran\", \n                                  margin = margin(0, 0, 5, 0)),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11.5, colour = \"#636363\", \n                                     family = \"catamaran\", \n                                     margin = margin(0, 0, 30, 0)),\n        plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n        plot.tag.position = c(0.11, 0.88),\n        plot.tag = element_text(size = 11.5, family = \"catamaran\", \n                                colour = \"#636363\", face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 9.5, colour = \"#636363\", \n                                    family = \"catamaran\", \n                                    margin = margin(15, 0, 0, 0),\n                                    hjust = 0),\n        plot.caption.position = \"plot\",\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = \"dotted\", \n                                          colour = \"#a7a7a7\"),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = \"#c9c9c9\"),\n        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, family = \"catamaran\", \n                                   hjust = 0.7, vjust = 0.5, \n                                   face = c('plain', 'plain', 'plain', \n                                            'bold', 'plain','plain', \n                                            'plain', 'plain', 'plain')),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(hjust = 0.78, margin = margin(0, 0, 20, 0), \n                                    size = 11.5, family = \"catamaran\", \n                                    colour = \"#636363\",\n                                   face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11, family = \"catamaran\", \n                                    colour = \"#636363\", margin = margin(r = 7)),\n        axis.title.x.top = element_text(vjust = 7.6),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n        plot.margin = margin(0, 1.7, 0, 0, \"cm\")) +\n     geom_label_repel(aes(x = 2, y = market_share_now, label = industry_labels,\n                         segment.alpha = 0),\n                    inherit.aes = FALSE, \n                    color = c(\"#505050\"), \n                    alpha = 2, hjust = 1,\n                    size = 3.2,\n                    force = 0.0016,\n                    force_pull = 10,\n                    direction = \"y\",\n                    xlim = c(2, NA),\n                    label.size = NA,\n                    box.padding = 0.002,\n                    family = \"catamaran\")\n\nalternative_plot\n\n\n\nAnnotations and other aditional settings\nFinally, I have added with the “annotate_interactive” function a label that\nindicates the lines that correspond to the technological industries. Also, I’ve\nused the “geom_point” function to put a point at the beginning of these lines so\nthat the reader can quickly identify them. With the “geom_segment” function I\nhave joined the point with the annotation by means of a line. Finally, the\n“geom_hline” function has allowed me to overlay a thicker, black line at 50%,\nthus highlighting industries that have a market share above this value.\n\n\nalternative_plot <- alternative_plot +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 50, size = 0.7, color = \"black\", linetype = \"dotted\") +\n  geom_segment_interactive(aes(x = 1.01, xend = 1.07,\n                   y = 80, yend = 83.5,\n                   tooltip = \"\",\n                   data_id = 1),\n               size = 0.17,\n               color = \"#E6B400\") +\n  geom_point_interactive(data = data.frame.points, \n                         aes(x, market_share_2000,\n                             tooltip = paste0(industry, \", since 2012\"),\n                             data_id = 1),\n             colour = \"#E6B400\") +\n  annotate_interactive(\"text\", x = 1.09, y = 84.7, label = \"2012\", \n                       size = 3.4, color = \"#E6B400\", \n                       fontface = \"bold\", family = \"catamaran\",\n                       tooltip = \"\", data_id = 1) +\n  annotate_interactive(\"text\", x = 1.11, y = 88, label = \"Technology\", \n                       size = 3.1, color = \"#E6B400\", \n                       fontface = \"bold\", family = \"catamaran\", \n                       tooltip = \"\", data_id = 1) +\n  annotate_interactive(\"text\", x = 1.11, y = 86.5, label = \"companies\", \n                       size = 3.1, color = \"#E6B400\",\n                       fontface = \"bold\", family = \"catamaran\",\n                       tooltip = \"\", data_id = 1)\n\nalternative_plot\n\n\n\nAdd interactivity with the package ggiraph\nInteractivity can be added to the graph previously created to expand information.\nIn this case I have decided that when placing the mouse over each line the rest\nlower their alpha, in such a way that it stands out. In addition, a label\nappears with the name of the industry that corresponds to that line along with\nthe percentage increase or decrease in market share between the different years.\nTo add interactivity I have used the R package “ggiraph”. When making the graph\nitself I have used the geoms from this library (for example,\n“geom_segment_interactive”). Finally, with the “girafe” function the\ninteractivity is added to the created graph and with “girafe_options” the\noptions are set. For example, I have selected the color and background of the\nlabels that appear and the font with “opts_tooltip”. With “opts_hover_inv” I\nhave set the opacity of the rest of the lines when I pass the mouse over one in\nparticular.\nBelow you can see the final result!\n\n\nalternative_plot_interactive <- girafe(ggobj = alternative_plot, width_svg = 6, \n                                       height_svg = 7)\nalternative_plot_interactive <- girafe_options(x = alternative_plot_interactive,\n                    opts_tooltip(\"background-color:gray;color:white;\n                                 font-style:italic;padding:6px;\n                                 border-radius:7px;\"),\n                    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.1;\"),\n                    opts_hover(css = \"opacity:1;\"),\n                    opts_sizing(rescale = TRUE, width = 0.75))\n\nalternative_plot_interactive\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is the most tricky part, as we have to\nbear in mind several aspects:\nTo put labels inside each segment of the bars we should use geom_bar_text().\nIt is similar to geom_text() and it is contained in library(ggfittext).\nAt the time when presenting this work (January 2023) ggfittext package is in\n“maturing” lifecycle, this means that some functions are in an experimental\nphase and may suffer changes and updates.\nIn this particular case, there was not specific documentation for dealing\nwith independent label color changes inside bars. So, I assigned default colors\nfor “Antigüedad” and then changed them manually relating “Values” with the\ndifferent levels of “Antigüedad”.\ngeom_bar_text has a contrast option (TRUE or FALSE) which gives black or\nwhite color to the label based on its background. The problem that I had was\nthat R assigned white labels only for the two darker blues in our plot, leaving\n“10-14 años” with black number labels.\n\n\np <- p + geom_bar_text(aes(label = paste0(`Valor`, \"%\"), colour = Antigüedad),\n                           position = \"stack\", \n                           reflow = TRUE, \n                           place = \"left\",\n                           family = \"chivo mono\",\n                           size = 20) + \n         scale_colour_manual(values = c(`0-4 años` = \"White\", \n                                        `5-9 años` = \"White\", \n                                        `10-14 años` = \"White\", \n                                        `Más de 15 años` = \"Black\"), \n                             guide = \"none\")\n\np\n\n\n\nFinal step: creating an interaction\nTo make the graph interactive I have used the package ggiraph(). Because it is\nvery recent and there is not much documentation and users’ feedback, it has some\nfunctions that are difficult to use or are not extended a lot.\nThe idea that ggiraph proposes is to redefine ggplot functions with the suffix\n_interactive. At the same time, key data has to be provided inside each function\nin order to ggiraph make the interaction. With this mechanism, ggiraph\nidentifies which parts of the plot have to interact and adds this movement to\nthe plot.\nParticularly for this graph, I find the presence f interactivity very important.\nThe way that information inside bars is plotted does not allow to see clearly\nincreases or decreases of percentages all along years (in the case of the two\ncentral columns: “5-9 años” and “10 -14 años”). Interactivity allows the reader\nto select individually these segments and makes them more easy to read.\n\n\ninteractive <- ggplot(mygraph, aes(Año, Valor, fill = Antigüedad, \n                                   data_id = Antigüedad)) +\n  geom_bar_interactive(stat = \"identity\", aes(`data-id`= Antigüedad), \n                       extra_interactive_params = \"data-id\") +\n  scale_fill_manual_interactive(extra_interactive_params = \"data-id\",\n                                 `data-id`= unique(mygraph$Antigüedad),\n                                 values=c(rgb(0.43, 0.89, 0.99), \n                                          rgb(0, 0.66, 0.91), \n                                          rgb(0.02, 0.4, 0.67), \n                                          rgb(0, 0.2, 0.53)),\n                                 guide = guide_legend_interactive(reverse=TRUE),\n                                 data_id = function(breaks) as.character(breaks)) +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(title = \"El parque automovilístico por antigüedad\",\n       caption = \"Fuente: Dirección General de Tráfico.

Especially, I am trying to improve readability of data and\ninformation organisation.\nThe original graph has some problems that need to be solved. First, and most\nimportant, is the data itself used. As it can be visually appreciated, there are\nseveral bars which are longer, and others fall short. This is due to a fail in\nthe rounding of data: 2012 and 2016 account for 101%, and 2014 and 2017 only\nreach 99%.\nSo, first step is to recalculate data, adjusting roundings properly.

For this reason, firstly, I\ndecided to make a simple line graph.

The first part of the article talks about how young students’ highest level of education compares to their parents’ highest level of education. Students who achieved a higher level than their parents are considered upwardly mobile, those who achieved the same level are considered to have experienced status quo mobility, and those who achieved a lower level are considered downward mobile. The second part of the article examines gender differences in education at a specific level. You can find the full article here.\nGraph to replicate (two graphs in one)\nThe graph that needs to be replicated is actually two graphs in one. The first graph (on the left) shows the differences in education mobility among OECD countries for students aged 25-34. The graph uses a dark purple color for students who achieved a higher education level than their parents, a light grey color for students who achieved the same level, and a yellow color for students who achieved a lower level. The second graph (on the right) shows the difference for the same countries, except for Russia and Japan (for which data is not available), but by country and gender for students who achieved a highest education level higher than high school. The first graph is a stacked percentage bar graph, and the second graph consists of dotted lines and points. Both graphs have annotations to label the categories. At first glance, the graphs do not appear to be complicated. Here is a link to the original graph:\nGraph to replicateLoad libraries and read the database\nThe first step was to load the libraries, in this case I only used two: tidyverse and patchworks. The second step was to read the database which was on a csv file.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\ndf <- read_csv(\"Data_on_intergenerational_mobility.csv\")\n\n\nAdjusting the data\nIn this part, the data for the first graph is adjusted by erasing rows that are not contained in the graph and pivoting the categories that we are interested into one single column. In this cases, into “Mobility_type” column. After this I created 3 different databases, each one of them containing only one category, this was done in order to arrange the graph in descending order of a specific category inside the “Mobility_type” column.\n\n\neduc <- df %>%\n  drop_na(Downward_Mobility) %>% \n  filter(Country != \"Northern Ireland\" &\n         Country != \"England\" &\n         Country != \"Sub-national entities\" &\n         Country != \"Partners\" &\n         Country != \"Average\"\n  ) %>%\n  pivot_longer(cols = ends_with(\"ility\"), \n               names_to = \"Mobility_type\", \n               values_to = \"Mobility_perc\") \n\ndf_order <- educ[educ$Mobility_type == \"Upward_mobility\", ]\ndf_order2 <- educ[educ$Mobility_type == \"Status_quo_Mobility\",]\ndf_order3 <- educ[educ$Mobility_type == \"Downward_Mobility\",]\n\n\nFirst graph\nThe code for this visual representation can be divided into six parts:\nPlotting the data as vertical columns (“stack”) and arranging it in descending order based on the Upward_mobility category.\nChanging the theme by removing elements such as axis.ticks, axis.texts, and background.\nAdding numbers to the graph using geom_text and adjusting their positions and formatting (e.g., adding a percent symbol or adding extra space).\nAdding a subtitle and adjusting its position and margin to make room for annotations.\nAdding annotations, including both text annotations and line (“segment”) annotations.\nAdjusting the plot coordinates to make it easier to combine it with the second graph.\n\n\np = educ

we are interested into one single column. In this cases, into “Beyond_Sex” column. After this I created 1 different database, containing only one category, this was done in order to arrange the graph in descending order of that specific category inside the “Beyond_Sex” column, in this case by female.\n\n\nbeyond =  df %>%\n  drop_na(Downward_Mobility) %>% \n  filter(Country != \"Northern Ireland\" &\n         Country != \"England\" &\n         Country != \"Sub-national

starts_with(\"Beyond\"),\n    names_to = \"Beyond_Sex\",\n    values_to = \"Beyond_perc\"\n  ) \n\n\n  bey_ordered = beyond %>% \n    filter(Beyond_Sex == \"Beyond_highscool_2014_F\") %>%\n    arrange(desc(Beyond_perc))\n\n\nSecond graph\nThe code for this visual representation can be divided into seven parts:\nPlotting the data points using “geom_point” and arranging them in descending order based on the Female category.\nChanging the theme by removing elements such as axis.ticks, axis.texts, and background.\nAdding numbers to the graph using geom_text and adjusting their positions and formatting (e.g., adjusting the position of the first numbers to the left and the position of the second numbers to the right).\nAdding a subtitle and adjusting its position and margin to make room for annotations.\nChanging the panel.grid composition to include horizontal dotted lines and solid vertical lines with the correct measures and positions.\nAdding annotations, including both text annotations and line (“segment”) annotations.\nAdjusting the plot coordinates to make it easier to combine it with the second graph.\n\n\np2 = beyond %>%\n  ggplot() +\n  aes(Beyond_perc,

24.4, \n           color=\"grey30\", alpha = 0.5)\n\n\nMerge both graphs into one\nIn the final part, I had to merge both graphs into one.This part was the most tricky for me because the dimensions of the plot were different and a lot of editing of the margins, plot_layout had to be done so they merged correctly. I also added a common title as a plot_annotation and a line in the middle just as the original graph.\n\n\np + p2 + plot_layout(ncol=2,widths=c(6,5)) + \n  annotate(\"segment\", x = -25, xend = -25, y = -15, \n           yend = 30, color = \"grey30\", alpha = 0.3) +\n   plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Education attainment in selected countries for 25-34 year old.\",\n    theme = theme(plot.title.position = \"plot\", \n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")\n  ))\n\n\n\nAlternative Representations\nI thought of creating different visual representations to display data. I first tried a tree map, but the values were difficult to read. I then considered using a multi-level circular packing, but this made it difficult to see the relative magnitudes of the values, and there were too many categories because each country was treated as a separate category. As a result, I chose to use the facet_wrap option and split the plot into categories based on the type of mobility for the first plot and sex for the second, with the same y-axis for all categories. I created two separate plots and combined them.\nGraph 1:\nTo create the first graph of the alternative representation, I followed these steps:\nI created a labeller argument to change the titles of each facet.\nI used geom(col) to add the data and arrange it in descending order of Upward_mobility value.\nI used facet_wrap to separate the data by type of mobility.\nIn the theme function, I removed some elements and adjusted others to achieve the desired aesthetics.\nI finally added numbers to the graph by using geom_text and adjusting their size.\n\n\neduc_names <- list(\n

desired order of the category and adding specific elements to only a few values like axis titles or geom texts. While the rest of the process was relatively straightforward, the most difficult part for me was merging the two graphs together. Determining the correct dimensions, aspect ratios, plot layout, coordinate limits, etc. was challenging. The final result may not have the exact desired dimensions, but it is similar to the original. I chose the facet_wrap option for the alternative representation because, in my opinion, it was a clear and tidy way to view the data, although it may not have been the most complex method I am satified with the end result.\n\n\n\n",

The Lancet 2020. Published online July 14.It shows the ranking by population of the countries in two years 2017 and 2100. Besides it gives some brief insights of the three main populous countries in 2100. It is remarkable that the ranking is from 1 to 10, but 4 other countries are added (the ones which are expected to have huge growth in 20100).\nDataframe\nAs the source of the graph doesn´t provide us with the dataframe we need to create it, since all the data are in the graph is easy to do it, as it follows:\n\n\n#Create my database:\ndf <- read.csv(\"database.csv\")\n\ngroup_colors <- c(China = \"#009ee5\", India = \"#0973cb\", U.S = \"#384aae\",\n                Indonesia = \"#603c9c\", Pakistan = \"#893e9b\", Brazil =\"#be388f\", \n                Nigeria = \"#e75c93\", Bangladesh = \"#e53e48\", Russia = \"#f96439\",\n                Japan = \"#f78c24\", VIRTUAL = \"#FFFFFF\", Ethiopia = \"#f5b314\",\n                Egypt = \"#98b245\", DRC =\"#40b87b\", Tanzania = \"#25a99b\")\n\n\nGraph outline\nWe prepare the outline of the graph, removing the axes, legend and everything that is not the lines. The lines are matched to the population, that is the reason why their width is variable. We match also the lines to the specific color of each country. We code that first line in order to use Constantia font. One of the most important facts of these lines is that the y limits are really big since they match the population, so we need to take this into account.\n\n\n#Needed to use \"Constantia\" Font\n#windowsFonts(\"Constantia\" = windowsFont(\"Constantia\"))\nfont_add(family = \"Constantia\", regular = \"constan.ttf\")\nshowtext_auto()\n\n#Schema of the graph, data and geoms\np <- ggplot(df) +\n  aes(x, y, alluvium=group, fill=group) +\n  geom_alluvium(decreasing=FALSE, alpha=1, width=30, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = group_colors) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")+\n  xlim(min(df$x) - 43, max(df$x) + 43) + \n  ylim(min(df$y) - 0.1e9, max(df$y) + 3.7e9) +\n  theme_void()\np\n\n\n\nPlotting the graph: annotations, text and labels\nThe legend in this plot is substituted by side annotations in the right and the left with the value of the population and the ranking, a part from the country. We manually set their position, using horizontal and vertical adjustments (notice that the y axis is really big and we need to use very large numbers). As only one part of the text is modified (with bold, color or size) we use html annotation to do this.\n\n\n#Plotting completely the graph\np +\n  geom_curve(x = 2003, y = 0.40e9, xend = 2114, yend = 0.5e9, linetype=\"dashed\",\n             color = \"black\", size = 0.5, angle = 20, curvature = 0) +\n  #adding labels and text\n  labs(title = \"Here's how IHME projects the most populous \\n countries will change by 2100.\",\n       subtitle = \"Top 10 Countries \\n by Population\") +\n  theme(text = element_text(family = \"Constantia\"),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 35, face = \"bold\"),  # Center subtitle\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2025, y = max(df$y) + 3.65e9, label = \"2017\", size = 4) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=2090, y = max(df$y) + 3.65e9, label = \"2100\", size = 4) +\n  annotate(\"richtext\", x=1988, y = 4.10e9, label = paste0(\n    \"<span style='color: #009ee5;

It clearly shows the difference in population from one year to the next and, moreover, how the general trend is one of population decline.\nThis alternative visualisation is based on the fact that the main idea of the graph is not to show the ranking of countries in terms of population, but rather to visualise the evolution of the population between these years (2017 and 2100). About the data we are going to use (created in the dataframe section) we must say that these are values formed from those of the previous graph, with the amount of population of 2100 and 2017 the percentage variation is calculated and from there the graph begins.\n\n\n#Create the dataset\ndf <- read.csv(\"database_alternative.csv\")\n\n# Reorder the rows of the data frame based on the variation values and establish categories\ndf <- df[order(df$variation), ]\ndf$pos_neg <- ifelse(df$variation < 0, \"negative\", \"positive\")\n\n\n\n\n#Create the plot\n\nggplot(df, aes(x = country1, y = variation, color = group_colors)) + #basic plot\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"red\", linetype = \"solid\", size = 2) + #to remark the 0\n  geom_segment(aes(x = country1, xend = country1, y = 0, yend = variation, color = pos_neg), size = 1) + \n  geom_point(size = 8.25, shape = 21, aes(fill = pos_neg, color = pos_neg)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = variation), color = \"black\", hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5,\n            size= 2, fontface = \"bold.italic\")+\n  coord_flip() + #to change axis position\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.background = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_blank()) +\n  #Adding labels and text\n  labs(x= \"Country\") +\n  labs(y = \"Variation (%)\") +\n  labs(title = \"Percentage Change in Population between 2017 and 2100\", size = 20) +\n  labs(subtitle = \"Top 10 Countries by Population in 2017 and 2100 respectively.\", size = 10) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 9, y = 246,\n           label = \"Ranking 2017 vs. 2100\", fontface = \"bold.italic\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 8, y = 246,\n           label = \"1.

One of them, the objective of this project, visually presents the evolution of use of eleven Social Networks since 2012 (although only 5 of them have available data for the whole time series).\nOriginal graph. Source: Auxier and Anderson, 2021.With it, their objective was to show how despite all controversies and negative feelings towards them, a majority of Northamericans still use at least one, and how their usage has increased through the last years. The goal of this project is to replicate the plot as closely as possible and to offer feasible enhancements and alternative visualizations.\nPlot construction\nInitial settings, getting the data\nFirst of all, we should load into R the necessary libraries to develop our work. In our case, we need the following three:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) #To use the pipe operator and filter data\nlibrary(ggplot2) #To produce the graph\nlibrary(showtext) #To include alternative fonts\n\n\nOnce we prepared our environment, it’s time for us to work with the data. In this case, the Pew Research Center uploaded a PDF file with the specific questions and answers used for the report, from which we created a CSV file. We anticipated our future needs and introduced the different variables in a long format, as we would later need it to develop the plot.\n\n\nread_delim(\"Data/database.csv\")\n\n# A tibble: 53 × 3\n    Year `Social media`   Use\n   <dbl> <chr>          <dbl>\n 1  2012 Twitter           13\n 2  2013 Twitter           14\n 3  2014 Twitter           19\n 4  2015 Twitter           20\n 5  2016 Twitter           21\n 6  2018 Twitter           24\n 7  2019 Twitter           22\n 8  2021 Twitter           23\n 9  2012 Instagram          9\n10  2013 Instagram         14\n# … with 43 more rows\n\nSo, we store our CSV file as a dataframe, also renaming the ‘Social media’ variable into just ‘Social’ for simplicity purposes. Additionally, we filter the first and last data values for each Social Network into another dataframe, as we later will need it to display the points in each side of the lines.\n\n\ndata <- read_delim(\"Data/database.csv\")\n\ndata <- data %>% rename(\n  \"Social\" = `Social media`\n)\n\nfiltered <- data %>% \n  group_by(Social) %>% \n  filter(Year==min(Year)|Year==max(Year))\n\n\nFont preparation and color setting\nIn this step, we start by adding into our document the fonts used by the authors. Note that we included the same font two times, the regular and the bold version; this is because we had some issues while trying to compute the bold aspect manually (with double asterisk at each side of the text).\n\n\nfont_add(family = \"Franklin Gothic\", regular = \"FRAMD.ttf\")\nfont_add(family = \"Franklin Gothic Demi\", regular = \"FRADM.ttf\")\nfont_add(family = \"Georgia\", regular = \"GEORGIAI.ttf\")\nshowtext_auto()\n\n\nThen, we create a vector assigning each possible Social Network to its displayed color in the graph, to then apply it to the lines setting.\n\n\ncolors <- c(\"Youtube\" = \"#bf4538\", \"Facebook\" = \"#23689a\", \n            \"Instagram\" = \"#6c9acf\", \"Pinterest\" = \"#747a46\",\n            \"Linkedin\" = \"#c2c88e\", \"Snapchat\" = \"#746a7c\", \n            \"Twitter\" = \"#d1aa42\", \"Whatsapp\" = \"#253a5c\",\n            \"TikTok\" = \"#e9a03f\", \"Reddit\" = \"#92885a\", \n            \"Nextdoor\" = \"#e28377\" )\n\n\nCoordinates, axes and scales\nOur panel base depends on two axis, years and usage rate (%).\n\n\np <- data %>% ggplot() +\n  aes(Year, Use)\n\np\n\n\n\nPrevious to mapping the data inside the plot, we need to set properly the labels, axes and scales.\n\n\np <- p +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = NULL,\n    limits=c(2012, 2021.9),\n    n.breaks = 10,\n    labels = function(x) paste0(\"'\", substr(x, 3, 4)),\n    expand=c(0,0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(\n    name = NULL,\n    limits=c(0, 100),\n    breaks = c(20, 40, 60, 80),\n    labels = c(\"20\" = \"20\", \"40\" = \"40\", \"60\" = \"60\", \"80\" = \"80\"),\n    expand = c(0,0)\n  ) \n\np\n\n\n\nNow, the first year is ‘12, just as the original plot, and we’ve set the y limits to 100%. We didn’t add the last vertical label, “100%”: this is because it’s placed slightly to the right, as the top grid is shorter than the rest, so we’ll later set it as an individual annotation. We can also check how the x axis doesn’t ’strictly’ end in ’21: this is because we’ve left some space to connect the last values to their labels through segments.\nOne characteristic aspect of this graphic is that it requires a lot of annotations in order to display its elements correctly. As our first one, we’ll set the grid lines (although we’ll not see them properly until applying the theme). The reason behind this is to avoid them extending 2021 when we leave space to connect the last points of data with the labels.\n\n\np <- p +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=10, yend=10, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=20, yend=20, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=30, yend=30, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=40, yend=40, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=50, yend=50, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=60, yend=60, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=70, yend=70, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=80, yend=80, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=90, yend=90, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012.25, xend = 2021, y=100, yend=100, \n           color = \"grey\", linetype=\"dotted\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2012, xend = 2021, y=0, yend=0, \n           color = \"grey\", alpha = 0.4) \n\np\n\n\n\nAdding the data\nNow that we’ve prepared the plot’s ‘skeleton’, it’s time for us to add the data. It’s important to do it after adding the grid annotations: if not, they would overlap the geom_line().\n\n\np <- p +  geom_line(aes(group=Social, color=Social), linewidth= 1) +\n  geom_point(data = filtered, aes(color=Social),\n             size = 1.75, shape = 21, fill=\"white\", stroke = 1) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors) \n\np\n\n\n\nTheme settings\nWe’ll now prepare the theme for previous and further changes. As seen in the original image, the background and plot margins are all white, vertical grid lines are not displayed, there are some margins we need to adjust at the right (to leave space for the labels and values) and at the bottom (to leave space for the last caption, “PEW RESEARCH CENTER”) and there are no axis ticks but for the years. Another important aspect is that the default legend is not included: we will create it manually as a kind of secondary axis, with side annotations.\n\n\np <- p +\n  theme(\n    axis.ticks.x.bottom = element_line(color = \"lightgrey\"),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = \"transparent\"),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_line(colour = \"transparent\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"transparent\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    axis.text.x.bottom = element_text(color=\"grey64\", \n                                    family = \"Franklin Gothic\"),\n    axis.text.y.left = element_text(color=\"grey64\", \n                                    family = \"Franklin Gothic\", hjust=-0.5, size=10),\n    axis.line.x.bottom = element_line(color=\"transparent\"),\n    axis.ticks.length = unit(0, \"pt\"),\n    axis.ticks.length.x.bottom = unit(5, \"pt\"),\n    plot.caption = element_text(family = \"Franklin Gothic\", \n                                color = \"grey64\", hjust = 0),\n    plot.caption.position = \"plot\",\n    aspect.ratio = 1.1,\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = \"Georgia\", \n                                 color = \"grey64\", hjust = 0.02, size=11),\n    plot.title = element_text(family = \"Franklin Gothic Demi\", hjust = 0, size=14.4),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.margin = margin(t=0,\n                         r=17,\n                         b=18,\n                         l=0)\n  ) +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"100%\", x=2012, y=100, color = \"grey64\", \n           family=\"Franklin Gothic\", size=3.5, hjust=1) +\n  coord_fixed(xlim=c(2012,2021), clip = 'off') \n\np\n\n\n\nWe also delete the previous grids and set the correct text settings, along with the “100% annotation” (it will display correctly after adding the title and subtitle) and a fixed coordinate system ending in 2021 (with clip = ‘off’ to allow us to annotate outside the plot limits).\nOur next step is to set the title, subtitle, caption and bottom annotation (this last one acting as a tag, but avoiding some placement problems). Note that now the plot space is complete and the “100%” mark does not appear as cut in half.\n\n\np <- p +\n  labs(title = paste(\" Growing share of Americans say that they use YouTube;\\n\", \n\"Facebook remains one of the most widely used online\\n\",\n\"platforms among U.S. adults\"),\n       subtitle = \"% of U.S. adults who say they ever use ...\",\n       caption = paste(\"Note: Respondents who did not give an answer are not shown.

looking at the graph by Auxier and Anderson, the first thing that can come to our minds is that, although the evolution through the last 9 year appears to be clear, the discriminability could be better. There are categories with the same color as others, and the distribution seems to be only ‘reasonable’ for the top two Social Networks, YouTube and Facebook, as they are depicted with their corporative colors. This is specially problematic if we take a look at the mid-bottom part of the chart, which compiles a lot of values very close to each other, resulting into some potential confusion at identifying each line or point with their respective category.\nAnother way of improving each category’s identification with the lines could be expanding the plot margins a little bit to the bottom, to avoid the excessive proximity between points that also results into very close reference lines, but we didn’t attempt to do it because excessive height for temporal series plots may distort the evolution shown, making it too difficult to visually see.\n\n\np <- pbase +\n  geom_line(aes(group=Social, color=Social), linewidth= 1) +\n  geom_point(data = filtered, aes(color=Social),\n             size = 1.75, shape = 21, fill=\"white\", stroke = 1) +\n  \n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"YouTube\", y=81, x=2021, hjust=-0.8, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#bf4538\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"Facebook\", y=69, x=2021, hjust=-0.73, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#23689a\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"Instagram\", y=46, x=2021, hjust=-0.68, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#d50167\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"Pinterest\", y=40, x=2021, hjust=-0.75, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#911821\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"LinkedIn\", y=34.5, x=2021, hjust=-0.82, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#0a63bc\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"Snapchat\", y=29, x=2021, hjust=-0.72, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#f7ce2c\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"Twitter\", y=24.5, x=2021, hjust=-0.96, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#189ef3\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"WhatsApp\", y=19, x=2021, hjust=-0.65, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#25ca45\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"TikTok\", y=15, x=2021, hjust=-1.03, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#f70079\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"Reddit\", y=11, x=2021, hjust=-1.05, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#f74301\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"Nextdoor\", y=6, x=2021, hjust=-0.75, size=3.5, \n           family = \"Franklin Gothic\", color = \"#8ace00\") +\n  labs(title = paste(\" Growing share of Americans say that they use YouTube;\\n\", \n\"Facebook remains one of the most widely used online\\n\",\n\"platforms among U.S. adults\"),\n       subtitle = \"% of U.S. adults who say they ever use ...\",\n       caption = paste(\"Note: Respondents who did not give an answer are not shown.

If we added some context underneath the evolution lines, that also showed evolution of other types of media (TV, Newspaper, Radio…), the viewer could easily contextualize the information, while making the graph richer. We understand this is a limitation of the used data, but they could use some alternative surveys also indicating in the caption that it comes from a different source.\nLet’s make some fictitious data in our CSV, adding TV usage, in order to see how it would look:\n\n\nread_delim(\"Data/database2.csv\") %>% \n  rename(\n  \"Social\" = `Social media`\n) %>% \n  filter(Social==\"TV\")\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n    Year Social   Use\n   <dbl> <chr>  <dbl>\n 1  2012 TV        54\n 2  2013 TV        52\n 3  2014 TV        53\n 4  2015 TV        50\n 5  2016 TV        45\n 6  2017 TV        43\n 7  2018 TV        42\n 8  2019 TV        37\n 9  2020 TV        35\n10  2021 TV        33\n\nTV <- read_delim(\"Data/database2.csv\") %>% \n  rename(\n  \"Social\" = `Social media`\n) %>% \n  filter(Social==\"TV\")\n\n\n\n\np <- p +\n  geom_col(data = TV, aes(Year, Use), alpha=0.35, width = 0.8) +\n  geom_line(aes(group=Social, color=Social), linewidth= 1) +\n  geom_point(data = filtered, aes(color=Social),\n             size = 1.75, shape = 21, fill=\"white\", stroke = 1) +\n  annotate(\"text\", label=\"TV usage\", x=2016.3, y=56,  color=\"grey\", \n           size = 3.5, family = \"Franklin Gothic\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=2015, xend=2015.8, y=50, yend=55, color=\"grey\")\n\np\n\n\n\nAlternative visualizations\nApart from these potential enhancements on the same graph, we could also imagine of new ways of representing the data, maybe more aligned with the objective of the article and the title itself. The way we see it, the importance remains in the current distribution of usage between different Social Media, which tells the reader that there is a high percentage of Northamerican consumers who use them despite bad social perceptions.\nThe evolution since 2012 (temporal mark when the graphic has no data for more than half of the categories) is also important, but can be transformed to make it more adequate, maybe taking 2018 as starting point.\n\n\nnew <- data %>%\nfilter(\n  Year>2017 & Year<2022\n) %>% \n  group_by(Social) %>% \n  filter(Year == max(Year) | Year == min(Year))\n\n\nWe set our last values, create a new column with the evolution since 2018 for each Social Media and leave only the 2021 value, also creating a zero column that will be the starting point.\n\n\nnew <- new %>% group_by(Social) %>% \n  mutate(\n    evo = last(Use) - first(Use),\n    zero = 0\n  ) %>% \n  filter(Year == max(Year))\n\n\nThe idea is to give more importance to the current ranking position (y position) and the latest evolution (x position), using a lollipop graph displaying the last trend.\nWe could also add the logos from each Social Network next to every name, to improve the understanding of the graph for those readers who are not very familiar with Internet.\n\n\nnew %>% ggplot() +\n  aes(zero, reorder(Social, Use)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend=evo, yend = Social), color = colors) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-10,10), n.breaks = 10) +\n  geom_point(aes(evo), size = 2, shape = 21, fill=colors, stroke = 1, color = colors) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = colors) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dotted\"),\n    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = \"lightgrey\", linetype = \"dotted\"),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_line(colour = \"grey\", linetype = \"dotted\"),\n    axis.title.x.bottom = element_text(),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = \"Georgia\", \n                                 color = \"grey64\", hjust = 0.02),\n    plot.title = element_text(family = \"Franklin Gothic Demi\", hjust = 0, size= 17),\n    plot.caption = element_text(family = \"Franklin Gothic\", \n                                color = \"grey64\", hjust = 0),\n    panel.border = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y.left = element_text(color = \"gray30\", family = \"Franklin Gothic\", size = 10),\n    axis.title.y.left = element_blank(),\n    plot.margin = margin(t=0,\n                         r=0,\n                         b=20,\n                         l=0)\n  ) +\n  labs(title = paste(\" Growing share of Americans say that they use YouTube;\\n\", \n\"Facebook remains one of the most widely used online\\n\",\n\"platforms among U.S. adults\"),\n       subtitle = \"% of growth of Social Media Usage for ...

We’ve also avoided the excessive dependence on the original graph on annotations and lines, so you can easier identify all values and labels with the segments.\n\n\n\n",

Polio is caused by a virus that spreads through contaminated food and water and can attack the nervous system, leading to paralysis in some cases.\nThe first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Dr. Jonas Salk. The first mass vaccination campaign against polio was launched in April of 1995 in the US. The oral polio vaccine was introduced in the US in 1961 and became the primary vaccine used for routine polio vaccination in the US in the 1970s.\nSince the introduction of the polio vaccine in the US, the incidence of polio has decreased dramatically. The last case of wild poliovirus was reported in 1979, and the disease has been considered eradicated in the US since 2000. The success of the polio vaccine in the United States and around the world has been one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.\nOriginal Plot - WSJ\nThe original plot was created by Tynan DeBold and Dov Friedman and published in February 2015 in an article in the Wall Street Journal, and is part of a series of graphics showing the effect of vaccines on different diseases such as measles, heaptitis A, mumps, pertussis, rubella, among others.\nOriginal Plot. Source: WSJ.The visualization was so good that it had a great impact on social networks…\nBill Gates’ reaction.Reproducing de Original Plot\n\n\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(grDevices)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(systemfonts)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(showtext)\n\n\nData Source –> tycho.pitt.edu\nThe data in the original plot is from tycho.pitt.edu, a research project aimed at improving the standards, machine readability and availability of global health data, which is sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh in the US.\nHowever, when we consulted the historical records of polio cases registered in the USA, we found that there are several polio viruses: Acute nonparalytic poliomyelitis, Acute paralytic poliomyelitis, Acute poliomyelitis.\nThe original plot does not specify which of the three viruses it refers to, so it was decided to use the information of all the viruses that make up the polio disease.\nAcute nonparalytic poliomyelitis\n\n\nPolio  <- read_csv(\"tycho_20221212-145444.csv\",\n                    col_types = cols_only(Admin1Name = col_guess(),\n                                          PeriodStartDate = col_guess(), \n                                        CountValue = col_guess()))%>% \n  mutate(PeriodStartDate = ymd(PeriodStartDate)) %>% \n  arrange(Admin1Name, by=\"name\") %>%\n  count(Admin1Name,lubridate::floor_date(PeriodStartDate, \"year\")) %>% \n  rename(State =Admin1Name, \n         Date = `lubridate::floor_date(PeriodStartDate, \"year\")`,\n         Cases = n)\n\n\nAcute paralytic poliomyelitis\n\n\nPolio1 <- read_csv(\"tycho_20221215-094815.csv\",\n                   col_types = cols_only(Admin1Name = col_guess(),\n                                         PeriodStartDate = col_guess(), \n                                         CountValue = col_guess()))%>% \n  mutate(PeriodStartDate = ymd(PeriodStartDate)) %>% \n  arrange(Admin1Name, by=\"name\") %>%\n  count(Admin1Name,lubridate::floor_date(PeriodStartDate, \"year\")) %>% \n  rename(State =Admin1Name, \n         Date = `lubridate::floor_date(PeriodStartDate, \"year\")`,\n         Cases = n)\n\n\nAcute poliomyelitis\n\n\nPolio2 <- read_csv(\"tycho_20221215-095240.csv\",\n                   col_types = cols_only(Admin1Name = col_guess(),\n                                         PeriodStartDate = col_guess(), \n                                         CountValue = col_guess()))%>% \n  mutate(PeriodStartDate = ymd(PeriodStartDate)) %>% \n  arrange(Admin1Name, by=\"name\") %>%\n  count(Admin1Name,lubridate::floor_date(PeriodStartDate, \"year\")) %>% \n  rename(State =Admin1Name, \n         Date = `lubridate::floor_date(PeriodStartDate, \"year\")`,\n         Cases = n)\n\n\nCleaning Data\nWe now have the three clean data sets with the number of cases by State and by date.\nNext we will merge the three data sets into one and then add up all the cases so that we have a consolidated file.\n\n\nAbb <- read_delim(\"US State Abbreviations.csv\", \n    delim = \";\", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)\n\nPoliojoint <- full_join(Polio2, Polio1, by = c(\"State\" = \"State\", \"Date\" =\"Date\"))\n\nPoliojoint1 <- full_join(Poliojoint, Polio, by = c(\"State\" = \"State\", \"Date\" =\"Date\"))\n\nPoliojoint2 <- left_join(Poliojoint1, Abb, by = c(\"State\" = \"States\"))\n\nPolio_sum <- Poliojoint2 %>%  mutate_at(c('Cases.x', 'Cases.y', \"Cases\"), as.numeric) %>% \n  mutate(sum_cases = rowSums(across(where(is.numeric)), na.rm=T), .keep = \"unused\") %>% \n  filter(Date >= '1928-01-01') %>% rename(States = Abb) %>% select(-State)\n\n\nColors\nTo copy the colors of the original plot, I used the website “html-color-codes.info” which allows to upload the image and obtain all the codes present in the image.\n\n\ncols <- c(colorRampPalette(c(\"#e7f0fa\", \"#c9e2f6\", \"#95cbee\", \"#0099dc\",\"#BAC843\", \n                            \"#4ab04a\", \"#ffd73e\", \"#eec73a\", \"#e29421\", \"#e29421\", \n                            \"#f05336\",\"#ce472e\"),bias=1)(11))\n\n\nOriginal Plot\nThe original graph is a heat map showing the number of polio cases reported in each U.S. state over time. For that reason, the x-axis will be the US states, and the y-axis will be the years and the plot will be filled by the number of cases.\n\n\np <- Polio_sum %>% ggplot() +\n  aes(x=Date, y=fct_rev(States),fill=sum_cases)\np\n\n\n\nAs this is a heatmap, to add rectangles we will use the geom_tile function. Additionally, the original plot has white spaces between the rectangles, so we are going to specify this inside the function.\n\n\np <- p + geom_tile(colour=\"white\", lwd = 0.2, linetype = 1)\np\n\n\n\nNext we are going to use the scale_fill_gradientn() function to set the fill color of the rectangles in a continuous gradient. The colors argument specifies the colors to use in the gradient, for which we will use the color palette defined above (“cols”). Then we define the minimum and maximum limits, which correspond to the minimum and maximum number of polio cases in a year. We include the breaks at which the gradient should change color, and specify the labels for these values.\nAdditionally, we use the guide argument to control the appearance of the color bar displayed next to the plot. For this purpose we define gradient marks, number of intervals to use for the gradient, and the color bar height and width arguments, respectively.\n\n\n p <- p+theme_minimal()+\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=cols,limits=c(0, 300),\n                       breaks=seq(0, 300, by=50),\n                       labels=c(\"0\", \"50\", \"100\", \"150\", \"200\", \"250\", \"300\"),\n                       guide=guide_colourbar(ticks=T, \n                                             nbin=50,\n                                             barheight=.6, \n                                             label=T, \n                                             barwidth=8, \n                                             ticks.colour= \"grey\", \n                                             ticks.linewidth = 0.5))\np\n\n\n\nWe use scale_x_date() function to set the scale of the x-axis to a date format. Then we need to specify the amount of space to add around the data. A value of c(0,0) means no space is added.\nThe breaks argument specifies the positions of the tick marks on the x-axis. In this case, the seq() function is used to generate a sequence of dates at 5-year intervals from 1930 to 1965.The date_labels argument specifies the format to use for the labels of the tick marks. In this case, the format “%Y” is used, which displays the year in four digits.\n\n\np <- p+ scale_x_date(expand=c(0,0), \n                     breaks = (seq(ymd(\"1930-01-01\"), ymd(\"1965-01-01\"), \n                                   by = \"5 years\")), \n                     date_labels = \"%Y\") \np\n\n\n\nTo include the line indicating the time at which the vaccine was introduced, we will use the function geom_segment(). In this case, the line segment will start at the date “1955-01-01” and end at the same date, so it will be a vertical line.\n\n\n p <- p + geom_segment(x=as.Date(\"1955-01-01\"), xend=as.Date(\"1955-01-01\"), \n                       y=0, \n                       yend=52.5, \n                       size=.9)\np\n\n\n\nNow we want to find the right font. For that we use the website “What the Font” which tells us the font used. However, the exact font has a high cost and is not available. Therefore, we searched Google fonts for the closest possible match, and found the Tajawal family font.\nTo use this font we make use of the “showtext” package, then we select the Google font we want using font_add_google(“Tajawal”), and then we call showtext_auto() to indicate that showtext is going to be automatically invoked to draw text whenever the plot is created.\n\n\nfont_add_google(\"Tajawal\")\nshowtext_auto()\n\n\nNow we use different functions to modify the appearance of the chart to make it resemble the original. The labs() function is used to remove the x-axis, y-axis and fill legend labels. The ggtitle() function is used to set the chart title. The theme() function is used to customize various aspects of the chart appearance, for example the aspect ratio, legend position, and axis labels and markings.\n\n\n p <-  p + labs(x=\"\", y=\"\", fill=\"\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Polio\") +\n  theme(    legend.position= \"bottom\",\n        legend.direction=\"horizontal\",\n        legend.text=element_text(colour=\"grey20\"),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(size=8, family=\"Tajawal\", \n                                 hjust=1),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(size=6),\n        axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x=element_line(color = \"grey50\", size = 0.5),\n    axis.line.x =element_line(color = \"grey50\", size = 0.5),\n        panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        title=element_text(hjust=-.07, face=\"bold\", vjust=1, \n                           family=\"Tajawal\"),\n        text=element_text(family=\"Tajawal\"))\np\n\n\n\nFinally, we add a label with the text “Vaccine introduced” to the plot at the specified x and y coordinates, using the specified font size and font family. The label will be aligned top left and the aspect ratio of the plot will be set.\n\n\n  p <- p+ annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"1955-01-01\"), y=55, label=\"Vaccine introduced\", \n           vjust=1, hjust=0, size=I(3), family=\"Tajawal\")\np\n\n\n\nAs can be seen, the plots are not identical because the data set used is not the same.\nAn attempt was made to use the same data set to replicate the original plot as closely as possible, but the same dataset was not found. For this reason, it was decided to use the three datasets with the three viruses that make up the polio, resulting in a slightly different plot.\nIn this version, we can see that after the introduction of the vaccine in 1955 there was no drastic decrease in the number of cases, but on the contrary there was a slight increase in 1956. In addition, we can see that the number of cases actually dropped significantly after 1961, which coincides with the date when an improved version of the vaccine was introduced in the US.\nImproved plot\nIt is a great challenge to make an improvement of a plot so well done and with so many recognitions. In fact, I personally consider that the original plot is the best way to visualize the effect of a vaccine in reducing the number of positive cases of contagion.\nTherefore, I am not going to propose a new plot. Instead, I am going to improve the original plot by adding more useful information.\nFirst, as the most important thing is to see the effect of the vaccine, let’s reduce the number of years exposed. To do this we will start in the year 1940 and end in the year 1970. For this purpose we will reduce the dataset.\n\n\nPolio_sum1 <- Polio_sum %>% filter(Date >= \"1940-01-01\" & Date <= \"1966-01-01\")\n\np1 <- Polio_sum1 %>% ggplot() +\n  aes(x=(Date), y=fct_rev(States),fill=sum_cases) + \n  geom_tile(colour=\"white\", lwd = 0.2, linetype = 1)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_x_date(expand=c(0,0), \n               breaks = (seq(ymd(\"1930-01-01\"), ymd(\"1970-01-01\"), \n                             by = \"5 years\")), date_labels = \"%Y\")+\n  labs(x=\"\", y=\"\", fill=\"\")+\n  theme(aspect.ratio = 6.5/12.5,\n        legend.position= \"bottom\",\n        legend.direction=\"horizontal\",\n        legend.text=element_text(colour=\"grey50\"),\n        axis.text.y=element_text(size=6, family=\"Tajawal\"),\n        axis.text.x=element_text(size=6),\n        axis.ticks.y=element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x=element_line(color = \"grey50\", size = 0.5),\n    axis.line.x =element_line(color = \"grey50\", size = 0.5),\n        panel.grid=element_blank(),\n        title=element_text(hjust=-.07, vjust=1, \n                           family=\"Tajawal\"),\n        text=element_text(family=\"Tajawal\"))\n\n\nI want to change the palette color to a color with more visual impact. That is why I want to choose a palette that makes it easier to see the years with the highest polio cases. That’s why I chose the YlGnBu palette from the RColorBrewer package, which gives a very interesting effect.\n\n\np1 <- p1 + scale_fill_gradientn(colours=brewer.pal(n=9, \"YlGnBu\"),limits=c(0, 300))\np1\n\n\n\nI want also to include a new line distinguishing between the two types of vaccines that were introduced in the U.S.: the injected vaccine invented and licensed in 1955 by Jonas Salk, and the improved oral vaccine invented by Albert Sabin that was introduced in 1961, targeting all types of polio.\nThis shows that it was only after the introduction of the second vaccine in 1961 that there was a real decrease in polio cases in the United States.\n\n\np1 <- p1 + geom_segment(x=as.Date(\"1955-01-01\"), xend=as.Date(\"1955-01-01\"), \n               y=0, yend=52.5, size=.9, color=\"grey50\", alpha=0.5)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"1952-01-01\"), y=56, label=\"First vaccine\", \n           vjust=1, hjust=0, size=I(3), family=\"Tajawal\", color=\"grey50\")+\n   geom_segment(x=as.Date(\"1961-01-01\"), xend=as.Date(\"1961-01-01\"), \n                y=0, yend=52.5, size=.9, color=\"grey50\", alpha=0.5)+\n  annotate(\"text\", x=as.Date(\"1960-01-01\"), y=56, label=\"Second vaccine\", \n           vjust=1, hjust=0, size=I(3), family=\"Tajawal\", color=\"grey50\")\np1\n\n\n\nNow, we will introduce a more explanatory title and subtitle about the plot.\n\n\np1 <- p1 + labs(title=\"Effect of the introduction of the two polio vaccines in the US\",\n       subtitle=paste(\"The heat map represents a visualization of the positive cases of Polio\",\n                      \"in the USA during the years 1928 and 1971 for the three existing virus\",\n                      \"\\ntypes (Nonparalytic poliomyelitis, Paralytic poliomyelitis, poliomyelitis),\",\n                      \"where the decrease of positive cases due to the introduction of the\",\n                      \"\\ntwo vaccines can be clearly seen.\"))+\n  theme(plot.subtitle=element_text(size=6), plot.title=element_text(size=10))\np1\n\n\n\nNow I want to include to the plot the number of cases presented in each of the states in order to easily visualize which of the states was the most affected by the polio virus.\nIn that sense, we are going to modify the dataset to obtain the cases presented in each state during the years 1928 and 1971.\n\n\nCasesxstate <- Polio_sum %>%  group_by(States) %>% summarise(total_cases = sum(sum_cases))\n\n\nNext, we are going to make a Barplot using the geom_col function, filling the bars with the colors representing the number of cases per state.\n\n\ncasebars <- ggplot(Casesxstate) + \n  aes(x=total_cases, y=fct_rev(States), fill=total_cases)+\n  geom_col(show.legend=FALSE)+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  scale_fill_gradientn(colors = brewer.pal(n=9, \"YlGnBu\"),\n                       limits=c(1000, 6000))+\n  scale_x_continuous()+\n  theme( aspect.ratio = 3/1, panel.grid=element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y=element_blank(),\n    axis.title.x=element_blank(),\n    axis.line.y=element_blank(), \n    axis.text.y=element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.y=element_blank(), \n    axis.text.x=element_text(size=6, colour=\"grey50\"), \n    axis.ticks.x=element_line(color = \"grey50\", size = 0.5),\n    axis.line.x =element_line(color = \"grey50\", size = 0.5))\ncasebars\n\n\n\nNext, we will use the patchwork package to assemble different plots. In our case, we are going to use the “inset_element” function to assemble the original plot with the new plot so that they are in the same plot. Let’s see.\n\n\np1+ inset_element(casebars, \n                       left=0.95, \n                       bottom=-0.1, \n                       right=1.22, \n                       top=0.965,\n                       align_to=\"panel\", \n                  clip = TRUE)\n\n\n\nWith these improvements to the plot we can more easily see the change of colors in relation to the number of polio cases, we can see the effect of the introduction of the second vaccine in the US and finally we can see the states that suffered the most from Polio during the years recorded.\nIn conclusion, this plot uses everything that a heat map is good for as it provides an initial view of the data and allows us to explore the information in a wide visual range. Additionally, it allows you to easily analyze the data, which allows you to find patterns and trends.\n\n\n\n",

Classical Solow-Swan models of growth predict convergence as a function of the deviation of a country from its stationary state (natural level) such that we should expect convergence between LEDC´S and MEDC´s. Our point of departure will be to launch the libraries we will use and to obtain the data from the Maddison Project Database.\nOriginal plot:\n\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\ngdp <- as.data.frame(read_delim(\"gdp per capita.csv\", \n                                delim = \";\"))\n\n\nA prior step to develop our plot will be to clean and sort the data to prepare it for our ggplot() operations. We will filter for rows containing data for 1950 and 2016 and reshape the data to have two columns accounting for GDP per capita for each country and for each year. This enables the analyst to depict a different axis for each of the years containing observations on GDP per capita.\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>% \n  rename(gdp_capita = gdp_per_capita) %>% \n  select(country, year,gdp_capita, ) %>% \n  filter(year %in% c(1950,2016)) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"year\", values_from = gdp_capita) %>% \n  drop_na(\"1950\", \"2016\") %>% \n  rename(gdp_capita_1950 = \"1950\", gdp_capita_2016 = \"2016\")\n\n\nIt will be useful for us to categorize our countries in three groups (poor, medium and rich countries) by generating a factor column using the ifelse() command in the following way:\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>% \n  mutate(type = ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<6000,\n                       \"poor\",\n                       ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<40000,\n                              \"medium\",\n                              \"rich\")))\n\n\nIt will be convenient for later (at the labelling stage) to generate a new column indicating the amount of growth an economy has undergone.\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>% \nmutate(fold = round(gdp_capita_2016/gdp_capita_1950,1)) %>%\n  mutate(fold = paste(fold,\"-fold\"))\n\n\nSince we will have many observations for each of the countries (especially for those with middle income), we will filter for a subset of the data by selecting a random sample of middle income countries and then binding the resulting dataframe to the original one:\n\n\nsubset <- gdp %>% \n    filter(type == \"medium\") %>% \n  slice(sample(1:73,35,replace = FALSE))\ngdp <- gdp %>% \n    filter(type != \"medium\") %>% \n    rbind(subset)\n\n\nNow we have everything we need to start depicting our graph! We will call our gdp data and pipe it into the ggplot() function, defining the aesthetics desired. The advantage of having previously pivoted our data is that now we have 2 columns which account for the desired variables to be plotted:\n\n\nplot <- gdp %>% \n  ggplot()+\n  aes(gdp_capita_1950,gdp_capita_2016)\nplot\n\n\n\nNow we will add some geometry to our plot. We will choose shape 21 in order to be able to fill the points with a different color from the one we will use for the contouring of it.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\n  geom_point(shape = 21,color = \"red\", size = 1.5, fill = \"aquamarine3\")\nplot\n\n\n\nOur plot requires a lot of labels inside the graph, both for lines and for points. We will take advantage of geom_text() and add some label to the geometry including a subheading accounting for the amount of growth each economy has undergone. We will later work on our annotations to the diagonal lines.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\ngeom_text(aes(label = country), size = 1, nudge_y = -0.02)+\n    geom_text(aes(label = fold), size = 1, nudge_y = -0.05)\nplot\n\n\n\nIt is time to choose appropriately the scales of our plot. A logarithmic scale will we used for both axis and we will have to introduce the dollar symbol to account for the unit of measurement. The breaks have to be manually provided by the analyst to mimic as much as possible the original plot.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\n   scale_x_log10(label = label_number(prefix = \"$\"), \n                 breaks = c(400,500,700,1000,1500,2000,3000,4000,5000,\n                            7000,10000,15000,20000,30000,40000,50000,70000))+\n   \n  scale_y_log10(label = label_number(prefix = \"$\"),\n                breaks = c(400,500,700,1000,1500,2000,3000,4000,5000,\n                           7000,10000,15000,20000,30000,40000,70000))\nplot\n\n\n\nTo stick with the original plot as much as possible, we will introduce some text in our axis and title (including a subtitle) and use a bold font for the latter.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\n  labs(x=\"GDP per capita in 1950\",\n       y = \"GDP per capita in 2016\",\n       title = \"GDP per capita in 1950 and 2016\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\n         \"GDP per capita is expressed in international -$. \",\n         \"This means that it is adjusted for price changes over \",\n         \"time (inflation) and for price differences between countries.\"))\nplot\n\n\n\nThere are many informative lines in our plot used to depict the growth rate of a country in comparison to 1950.. We will use the geom_abline() to choose the slope and intercept of each one and change the color to stick to the original plot. The RGB technique will be used to determine the color of interest and the fourth argument of this function refers to the transparency (alpha), which we will set for the diagonal lines. The intercepts with the y-axis have to be transformed by the logarithm.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\ngeom_abline(slope = 1,intercept = 0, color = \"darkblue\")+\n    geom_abline(slope=1,\n                intercept=log10(c(0.5, 2, 3,\n                                  4.4, 10, 15, 30)), linetype=\"dotted\",\n                color = rgb(0,0,0.5,0.3))\nplot\n\n\n\nIn this section we will work on the theme (appearance of the plot). Notice that each of the axis has some specific color associated with it (in accordance with the horizontal and vertical grid lines). In this case, the background lines are faded and we will resort to the RGB mixture of colors providing an alpha for each color. These kind of lines will be chosen as linetype “dotted to achieve the desired dashed effect. The aspect.ratio will be set to 1 inside the theme to ensure that the proportions of the final plot obey the ones of the original graph.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\ntheme(axis.text.x = element_text(colour = \"darkorchid3\", size = 2.9),\n      axis.title.x = element_text(colour = \"darkorchid3\", size = 9,family = \"serif\"),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(colour = \"cyan3\", size = 4,family = \"serif\"),\n      axis.title.y = element_text(colour = \"cyan3\", size = 9, family = \"serif\"),\n      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 5, colour = rgb(0,0,0,0.6),hjust = 0.4,\n                                   vjust = 5,family = \"serif\"),\n      panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n      panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = rgb(0.6,0.196,0.8,0.4),\n                                        linetype = \"dotted\"),\n      panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color = rgb(0,1,1,0.4), linetype = \"dotted\"),\n      plot.title = element_text(size = 14,hjust = -0.2, vjust = 1, family = \"serif\"),\n      aspect.ratio = 1)\nplot\n\n\n\nCoordinates will be kept ass Cartesian but we will employ the use of some limits to mimic the ones from the original plot.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\ncoord_cartesian(xlim = c(400,70000), ylim = c(400,70000))\nplot\n\n\n\nWe will now work on the annotations accompanying the vertical lines which will indicate the amount of growth that each of the countries have experienced since 1950, thus, conveying the idea of convergence/divergence among them.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\nannotate(\"text\", label = \"Countries above this line had positive growth\",\n         color = \"darkgreen\", x = 22000, y = 25000, angle = 45, size = 2.3,\n         family = \"serif\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", label = \"Countries below this line had negative growth\",\n             color = \"red\", x = 26000, y = 23000, angle = 45, size = 2.3,\n             family = \"serif\")\nplot\n\n\n\nIn addition to these annotations, we will add the final text annotations pertaining to the rest of diagonal lines adding a smaller size and accounting them with a different color. The 45 degree angle will be held constant since all lines hold a slope equal to unity but with different intercepts.\n\n\nplot<- plot+\n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"2x poorer\", color = rgb(0,0,0.6,1), \n           x = 61000, y = 36000, angle = 45, size = 1.7,family = \"serif\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", label = \"2x richer\", color = rgb(0,0,0.6,1),\n             x = 30000, y = 65000, angle = 45, size = 1.7,family = \"serif\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", label = \"3x richer\", color = rgb(0,0,0.6,1),\n             x = 19000, y = 65000, angle = 45, size = 1.9,family = \"serif\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", label = \"Global average \\n growth (4.4x)\",\n             color = rgb(0,0,0.6,1),  x = 11000, y = 63000, angle = 45, \n             size = 1.9,family = \"serif\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", label = \"10x richer\", color = rgb(0,0,0.6,1),\n             x = 5700, y = 67000, angle = 45, size = 1.9,family = \"serif\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", label = \"15x richer\", color = rgb(0,0,0.6,1),\n             x = 4000, y = 68000, angle = 45, size = 1.9,family = \"serif\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", label = \"30x richer\", color = rgb(0,0,0.6,1),\n             x = 2000, y = 68000, angle = 45, size = 1.9,family = \"serif\")\nplot\n\n\n\nAs a final note, we will recall all the problems we encounter on this plot and use this to propose an enhancement:\nEven with a subset of countries, there is a lot of geometry text overlapping -> We will improve the labelling\nIt is difficult to account for convergence across countries since all countries are plotted independent of their nature -> We will distinguish between groups of countries\nIn order to enable the reader extract information on both the country and the level of growth rate, we will provide to distinctive plots such that one contains country labels whereas the other one will resort to quantitative (regression analysis) information\nConvergence is difficult to observe due to axis selection -> We will modify the vertical axis to depict growth rate and help the reader check for convergence with ease\nGraph enhancement\nWe will use the same graph to propose some enhancements or changes in the way the data is presented in an attempt to ease reader´s comprehension. We will reload the data to our Rstudio code:\n\n\ngdp <- as.data.frame(read_delim(\"gdp per capita.csv\", \n                                  delim = \";\"))\n\n\nThe same technique employed before to clean and prepare our data will be recycled. Recall we are just proposing an improvement of the visualization, an alternative graph will be proposed in the last section of the project. Once again, we categorize our countries into rich, medium and poor:\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>%\n    rename(gdp_capita = gdp_per_capita) %>%\n    select(country, year,gdp_capita, ) %>%\n    filter(year %in% c(1950,2016)) %>%\n    pivot_wider(names_from = \"year\", values_from = gdp_capita) %>%\n    drop_na(\"1950\", \"2016\") %>%\n    rename(gdp_capita_1950 = \"1950\", gdp_capita_2016 = \"2016\") %>%\n    mutate(type = ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<6000,\n                         \"Poor\",\n                         ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<30000,\n                                \"Medium\",\n                                \"Rich\")))\n\n\nThe main difference with the first plot is that, this time, we will resort to the inclusion of a new column which will summarize the average annual growth rate that each economy has undergone since 1950.\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>% \n mutate(Growth = (((gdp_capita_2016/gdp_capita_1950)^(1/(2016-1950)))-1)*100)%>%\n    mutate(type = factor(type, levels = c(\"Poor\",\n                                          \"Medium\",\n                                          \"Rich\")))\n\n\nAs we mentioned previously, the plot will be the same but we will just change the way the data is presented, so the random filter to select countries will be preserved:\n\n\nsubset <- gdp %>% \n    filter(type == \"medium\") %>% \n    slice(sample(1:73,35,replace = FALSE))\n  gdp <- gdp %>% \n    filter(type != \"medium\") %>% \n    rbind(subset)\n\n\nWe can begin with our enhanced graph! The aesthetics provided now will be set to the gdp per capita in 1950 and the annual growth rate we computed before. We will make use of our geom_label() again but we will omit supplying R with geom_point() this time. The color of the text will be set to white in order to generate a comfortable contrast with the “filling” by type of economy we had established in our aesthetics.\n\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nplot_1 <-gdp %>%\n    ggplot()+\n    aes(gdp_capita_1950,Growth, fill = type)+\n    geom_label_repel(aes(label = country), size = 2,\n                     segment.color = 'transparent', max.overlaps = 40,\n                     force = 1, color = \"white\",\n                     show.legend = FALSE)\n    plot_1\n\n\n\nWe will add some labels to our axis and set the title to convey the idea that we are working with convergence. The word “conditional” here refers to the fact that we are going one step further and categorizing our data between types of economies and we will finally visualize the concept of “conditional convergence” presented in the classical Solow model of growth.\n\n\nplot_1 <- plot_1 +\nlabs(x=\"GDP per capita in 1950\",\n         y = \"Average GDP Growth Rate\")\nplot_1\n\n\n\nWe will provide a continuous y scale with the percentage suffix to make it obvious that we are working with growth rates here. We will also begin by applying a minimal theme to our plot which will be modified later with slight changes.\n\n\nplot_1 <-\nplot_1 + theme_minimal()+\n    scale_y_continuous(label = label_number(suffix = \"%\"), n.breaks = 6)\n    plot_1\n\n\n\nWe will work on the themes by providing some font in the type of “serif” and eliminating any background grid which may distract the reader. We will not devote much effort into changing the theme appearance because we are just modifying some changes of the original plot, not changing the graph completely. The aspect ratio will be set again to 1 to keep the original proportions.\n\n\nplot_1 <- plot_1 +\ntheme(axis.text.x = element_text( size = 7),\n      axis.title.x = element_text( size = 12,family = \"serif\"),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7,family = \"serif\"),\n      axis.title.y = element_text( size = 12, family = \"serif\"),\n      panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey\"),\n      panel.grid = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_blank(),\n      aspect.ratio = 1)\nplot_1\n\n\n\nFinally, let´s change the limits on the plot to make it more readable by modifying the arguments of the coordinate system:\n\n\nplot_1 <- plot_1+\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,10000), ylim = c(-2,7))\nplot_1\n\n\n\nNow we will generate the second plot required for our enhancement resorting to a similar analyis as the one depicted above but focusing on the quantitative side. We will append next to plot_1 the corresponding representation of each linear regression accounting for our three country groups. As usual, we will have to read again our data to make from scratch the desirable transformations:\n\n\ngdp <- as.data.frame(read_delim(\"gdp per capita.csv\",\n                                  delim = \";\"))\n\n\nOne again, we will have to split our country in three categories and generate our “Growth” column accounting for the rate of increase of GDP per capita that each economy experiences. Factor levels will be reset to obtain the desired order:\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>%\n    rename(gdp_capita = gdp_per_capita) %>%\n    select(country, year,gdp_capita, ) %>%\n    filter(year %in% c(1950,2016)) %>%\n    pivot_wider(names_from = \"year\", values_from = gdp_capita) %>%\n    drop_na(\"1950\", \"2016\") %>%\n    rename(gdp_capita_1950 = \"1950\", gdp_capita_2016 = \"2016\") %>%\n    mutate(type = ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<6000,\n                         \"Poor\",\n                         ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<30000,\n                                \"Medium\",\n                                \"Rich\"))) %>%\n    mutate(Growth = (((gdp_capita_2016/gdp_capita_1950)^(1/(2016-1950)))-1)*100) %>%\n    mutate(type = factor(type, levels = c(\"Poor\",\n                                          \"Medium\",\n                                          \"Rich\")))\n\n\nNow we can start depicting the second part of our enhancement graph! The first part will consist of piping our already filtered data into ggplot() and select the appropriate aesthetics in which we will feed our argument “fill” with our country type.\n\n\nplot_2 <-  gdp %>%\n    ggplot()+\n    aes(gdp_capita_1950,Growth, fill = type)\nplot_2\n\n\n\nNotice that, different to plot_1 in which we mapped a text geometry into the plot to be able to spot each of the countries, our task now is to account for types of countries regardless of their label. Therefore, we will change the geometry to geom_point() and let the point be filled with the type of country while contouring it with a white color:\n\n\nplot_2 <- plot_2 +\ngeom_point(shape = 21, color = \"white\", size = 3)\nplot_2\n\n\n\nWe will add some labels to the axis (the same that we had for our previous plot):\n\n\nplot_2 <- plot_2 +\n labs(x=\"GDP per capita in 1950\",\n         y = \"Average GDP Growth Rate\")\nplot_2\n\n\n\nLet´s change the label of the vertical axis by adding a percentage symbol to indicate that it is a measure of percentage growth rate. This has been computed as the average annual growth rate, which is the growth rate required for a country to portray year by year (constant) to achieve the final level of GDP per capita:\n\n\nplot_2 <- plot_2+\nscale_y_continuous(label = label_number(suffix = \"%\"), n.breaks = 6)+\n  theme_minimal()\nplot_2\n\n\n\nNext, we will change the appearance of our plot by modifying slightly the theme layout. Family “serif” will be chosen for the font in order to mimic the one used in the replication of the original plot and the background will be fill with grey. Panel grid lanes will be removed by setting the corresponding argument into element_blank().\n\n\nplot_2 <- plot_2 +\ntheme(axis.text.x = element_text( size = 7),\n      axis.title.x = element_text( size = 12,family = \"serif\"),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7,family = \"serif\"),\n      axis.title.y = element_text( size = 12, family = \"serif\"),\n      panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey\"),\n      panel.grid= element_blank(),\n      legend.position = \"bottom\",\n      legend.background = element_rect(size = 2),\n      aspect.ratio = 1)\nplot_2\n\n\n\nFinally, a linear regression line will be passed through each of the country groups to account for conditional convergence. The negative relationship which can be easily spotted once the line of best fit is included shows that, within groups of similar countries holding similar characteristics (depreciation rates, population growth rates etc.), there is convergence. However, the transition of a country from one group to another one is rarely seen.\n\n\nplot_2 <- plot_2 +\ngeom_smooth(method = \"lm\", size = 1, color = rgb(1,1,1,0.3))\nplot_2\n\n\n\nWe will change some limits of this plot to enable the reader focus on the inside and not get distracted with a hughe portion of unused plot:\n\n\nplot_2 <- plot_2 +\n coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,15000), ylim = c(-2,7))\nplot_2\n\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(ggpubr)\nenhancement <- ggarrange(plot_1,plot_2,  common.legend = TRUE, legend=\"bottom\")\nannotate_figure(enhancement,\n                top = text_grob(\"Gdp per Capita Conditional Convergence\",\n            color = \"red\", size = 19))\n\n\n\nAlternative representation 1\nNow that we have resorted to an enhancement of the original plot in order to provide a measure of within group convergence, we will propose an alternative graphical analysis to show between group divergence. In other words, we will see, for each year, how the distribution of income holds for each of our country groups to highlight the difficulty of an economy of jumping from one group to another one.\nWe will have to read again the data to start from scratch our alternative plot:\n\n\ngdp <- as.data.frame(read_delim(\"gdp per capita.csv\",\n                                  delim = \";\"))\n\n\nWe will only keep data from 1950 onwards and we will filter for any NA´s present (missing observations). The difference with our previous plots is that we will now use all of our economies (no filter selection) and we will plot, for each year, how income per capita is distributed among our countries (the evolution of distribution of wealth).\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>%\n    select(country,year,gdp_per_capita) %>%\n    filter(year>=1950) %>%\n    drop_na(gdp_per_capita)\n\n\nWe will pivot our data into wide format because we desire a column indicating the GDP per capita and the corresponding year in order to enable the analyst to generate the new column assigning the type of economy (factor).\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>% \npivot_wider(names_from = \"year\",\n                values_from = gdp_per_capita,\n                names_prefix = \"Year\") %>%\n    mutate(type = ifelse(Year2016<6000,\n                         \"Poor\",\n                         ifelse(Year2016<30000,\n                                \"Medium\",\n                                \"Rich\")))\n\n\nNow we will reshape our data back to long format for the sake of our alternative representation. This is a different route we are taking with respect to the original plots, but it will be useful for operating with all years and not just 2 specific ones (as earlier). We separate the pivoted columns to eliminate the unnecesary ones and keep just a year and a gdp per capita column:\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>% \npivot_longer(starts_with(\"Year\"),\n                 names_to = \"Year\",\n                 values_to = \"gdp_per_capita\") %>%\n    separate(Year, c(\"Yeard\", \"Year\"), remove = TRUE, sep =4) %>%\n    select(-Yeard) %>%\n    drop_na(everything())\n\n\nFinally, we will reorder the levels of our factor for a more appealing representation of our faceting and we will generate a new dataframe which contains all information that our original dataset contained with the exception of country type. We do this because we will use both dataframes in our plot to work with the faceting.\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>%\n   mutate(type = factor(type, levels = c(\"Poor\",\n                                         \"Medium\",\n                                         \"Rich\")))\n gdp_2 <-\n  gdp %>%\n  select(-type)\n\n\nWe pipe our gdp dataset into ggplot() and define our desired aesthetics:\n\n\nplot <-\ngdp %>%\n  ggplot()+\n    aes(Year,gdp_per_capita)\nplot\n\n\n\nNow we will add two geometries which correspond, in this case, to lines that account for the distribution of income per capita each year and for each economy. First we do this with the original data frame and then we mimic the code with the filtered dataframe and we add some alpha in order to achieve this effect in which the important segment of the data is being highlighted.\n\n\nplot<-\nplot+\ngeom_line(data = gdp_2, color = rgb(0,1,0,0.3))+\n  geom_line(color= rgb(0,1,0,1))\nplot\n\n\n\nNow we facet by type of economy…\n\n\nplot <- plot+\nfacet_wrap(~factor(type))\nplot\n\n\n\nLet´s add some labels to our plot. We will improve the readings of the axis and set a title to account for the divergence between countries. This is the case because we see that, although we did see within group (conditional) convergence in our enhancement plot, now one observes that, if we treat countries as a whole by groups, there is some divergence taking place.\n\n\nplot <-\n  plot+\nlabs(y = \"GDP per capita\", x = \"Time\",\n       title = \"Between Group Divergence\")\nplot\n\n\n\nOnce again, we work the scaling of our graph and change the label of the vertical axis to dollars. Timing will only display some years to avoid overlapping and improve readability.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\nscale_x_discrete(breaks = c(1950,1960,1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar())\nplot\n\n\n\nThe final theme will be set now. We begin with a general dark theme and then make some final adjustments. Years in the horizontal axis will be given some angle to enable us to fit more information and the title will be set in the center of our plot. This will be our first proposal for an alternative representation.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\ntheme_dark()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, angle = 90),\n        strip.text.x =element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size =14))\nplot\n\n\n\nAlternative representation 2\nOur previous plot operated with the distribution of income per capita within groups to be able to compare across our three types of economies (e.g. variance and overal growth). Our second proposal for alternative visualization will focus on the between-group convergence and reinforce the idea of the set of hardships involved in the process of an economy evolving from a lower class to a higher one. We load again our data to start from scratch, as usual:\n\n\ngdp <- as.data.frame(read_delim(\"gdp per capita.csv\",\n                                delim = \";\"))\n\n\nNext, we will have to perform similar operations we resorted to in previous sections by filtering only those years corresponding to 1950 and 2016 and arranging each country into its corresponding group.\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>%\n  rename(gdp_capita = gdp_per_capita) %>%\n  select(country, year,gdp_capita, ) %>%\n  filter(year %in% c(1950,2016)) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"year\", values_from = gdp_capita) %>%\n  drop_na(\"1950\", \"2016\") %>%\n  rename(gdp_capita_1950 = \"1950\", gdp_capita_2016 = \"2016\") %>%\n  mutate(Class = ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<6000,\n                       \"Poor\",\n                       ifelse(gdp_capita_2016<30000,\n                              \"Medium\",\n                              \"Rich\")))\n\n\nThe difference with previous plots is that we will now use the overall average annual growth rate from 1950 to 2016 which is the average growth an economy has yearly undergone to achieve their gdp per capita level in 2016. We also attach a measure of the mean average growth for each of our classes to enable the reader to spot the first differences:\n\n\ngdp <- gdp %>%\n  mutate(AAGR = ((gdp_capita_2016/gdp_capita_1950)^(1/(2016-1950))-1)*100)\ngdp %>%\n  group_by(Class) %>%\n  summarise(av_AAGR = mean(AAGR))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  Class  av_AAGR\n  <chr>    <dbl>\n1 Medium   2.79 \n2 Poor     0.917\n3 Rich     3.27 \n\ngdp <- gdp %>%\n  filter(Class != \"Rich\") %>%\n  mutate(AAGR_diff = 3.26 - AAGR)\n\n\nWe can now start building our plot layer by layer. We pipe in our already filtered data into ggplot() and set the aesthetics such that the horizontal axis accounts for each of the economies and the vertical one measures the growth rate difference between each country and the average one for rich countries. Therefore, high figures for the vertical axis correspond to countries that need to inject a considerable amount of per capita growth rate (annually) in order to catch up with rich economies and viceversa. The argument introduced in geom_bar() will be set to identity because the default for a bar plot is to count th enumber of observations in a column, and we want to plot the column corresponding to the growth rate difference. Notice that we have reordered from lowest to highest to achieve a visually more attractive graph.\n\n\nplot <- gdp %>%\n  ggplot()+\n  aes(reorder(country,AAGR_diff), AAGR_diff, fill = Class)+\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")\nplot\n\n\n\nNow we will set a void theme for our plot because we want to eliminate any axis text and clean the general appearance (we will work in the themes at the end) and add some labels for the acknowledge the reader with a better understanding of the plot:\n\n\nplot <- plot +\ntheme_void()+\n  labs(title = \"The Spiral of convergence\",\n       subtitle = paste0(\n         \"Countries contained inside the white circle are already growing \",\n         \"at the rate of a rich economy\"),\n       caption = paste0(\n         \"Countries falling in the dark regions require an additional \\n\",\n         \"annual average growth rate to catch up with leading economies\"))\nplot\n\n\n\nNow its time to work on the appareance of our graph. The panel grid lines will be removed by setting an element_blank() argument and the aspect ratio will be set so that we can observe a wider spiral in the final graph. The colors chosen for the bar plots are green and purple which contrast among then whereas the background layers will be set in black as a final step:\n\n\nplot <- plot +\nscale_fill_discrete(type = c(\"purple\", \"green\"))+\n  theme(legend.background = element_rect(color = \"black\"),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, vjust = 3, size =16),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n        aspect.ratio = 0.8,\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9,hjust = 0),\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 9,hjust = 0),\n        legend.key = element_rect(color = \"white\", size = 2),\n        legend.key.width = unit(2,\"lines\"),\n        legend.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\nplot\n\n\n\nWe will have to add some annotations in our plot to point the amount of growth injection each economy needs. These lines and annotations will make more sense once the polar coordinates have been applied. We encourage the reader to come back to these steps after the plot is over to understand how each of our elements gets settled in the final spiral.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\ngeom_abline(slope = 0,\n            intercept = c(-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4),\n            color = rgb(0,0,0,0.3), linetype = \"dotted\")+\n  annotate(geom=\"text\", x=-10,\n           y=c(-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4), label=c(\"-2%\",\"-1%\",\"0%\",\"1%\",\"2%\",\"3%\",\"4%\"),\n           color=\"black\",size =3,angle = 28)\nplot\n\n\n\nFinally, we have to add some rectangular geometries for different segments of the plot which will be given some alpha (transparency) to account for best to worse layers. These layers mimic the level curves of a three dimensional bowl in which each layer projected in the floor corresponds to a circle. We will see this once we apply our polar coordinates.\n\n\nplot <- plot +\nannotate(\"rect\", ymin = -2, ymax = -1,\n         xmin = -10, xmax = 110, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.1)+\n  annotate(\"rect\", ymin = -1, ymax = 0,\n           xmin = -10, xmax = 110, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.2)+\n  annotate(\"rect\", ymin = 0, ymax = 1,\n           xmin = -10, xmax = 110, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.3)+\n  annotate(\"rect\", ymin = 1, ymax = 2,\n           xmin = -10, xmax = 110, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.4)+\n  annotate(\"rect\", ymin = 2, ymax = 3,\n           xmin = -10, xmax = 110, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.5)+\n  annotate(\"rect\", ymin = 3, ymax = 4,\n           xmin = -10, xmax = 110, fill = \"black\", alpha = 0.6)\nplot\n\n\n\nWe can now apply our polar coordinates!\n\n\nplot <- plot +\ncoord_polar()\nplot\n\n\n\nThe first alternative representation deals with the evolution of the distribution of GDP per capita whereas the second one conveys this information in terms of differences in average growth rates with respect to rich economies. The results arising from the first section of the paper point at the existence of conditional convergence between similar economies and we highlight the difficulties an economy faces in jumping from one class to another in the outcome stemming from our alternative plots.\n\n\n\n",

The author of the visualization is Preethi Lodha, and the author of the article is Carmen Ang.\nThis report aims to discuss Preethi Lodha’s (Lodha 2022) graphic in the light of data visualization theory. Thus, some questions that will guide this narrative are: What information does it intend to show? Does it achieve it? How and through what encodings and channels? What are its strengths and points of improvement? Likewise, improvements and alternative visualizations are proposed, which are also not without their own room for improvement.\nBackground\nThe article collected data from the 2021 Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Specifically, the data used for the visualization was that published in PDF format in Table 2602. Generation of reference person: Annual expenditure means, shares, standard errors, and coefficients of variation.\nThe source of the article and the original graphic can be accessed here. This report was written in December 2022.\nWhat is it for? Representing how Americans distributed their spending in 2021\nFirst, the context and intentionality must be understood. The graphics must be understandable by themselves, and also in their context.\nAs for the article on the Visual Capitalist website, it has as newsworthiness —in Spanish journalist jargon we call it “la pepa”— to show the distribution of Americans’ spending in 2021. Although the title of the article does not specify that the information is from the previous year —it was written and published in 2022—, but the information is from 2021- this type of generalization or omissions are common in the titles and/or in the headlines of journalistic articles: they are licenses that journalists give themselves to attract the reader’s attention. The content of the article clearly specifies the source of information—the PDF—and that it refers to 2021. So it’s not a time series, it’s just a picture of that moment.\nScreenshot of the public Tableau dashboard How Americans spend their money, by Preethi Lodha. Published in: https://www.visualcapitalist.com/cp/how-americans-spend-their-money-2022/As for the graphic, the author used Tableau to build a bump chart that includes interactive elements when hovering over the dots; but for the purposes of this report, those elements will not be taken into account: only what is seen in the screenshot above is considered.\n\nNote that we use the term bump chart because this type of visualization is commonly found with that name on the Internet. However, in the article of the Visual Capitalist they refer to it as a “graph” and in this report we try to call the other visualizations as “graphic,” as proposed by Wilkinson and Wills (2005).\nBump charts are useful for exploring changes in rank over time across different categories. That is, they usually do not show the actual values of the categories —which in this case would be the money spent by each generation for each spending category—, but the positions in the ranking. In this case, the ranking moves of 14 spending categories are shown, based on the birth year range from the Silent generation (the oldest) to Generation Z.\nAt first glance, this and, in general, all bump charts shows three variables in an easy-to-understand way: category, time and position. That’s especially true in cases of graphics where the only important thing is the ranking. For example, this image from The Washington Post from 2015 shows the “favorite” dog breeds, according to the American Kennel Club, where the three important variables are breed of dog, year, and position in the ranking (Bump 2021).\nArticle published by Philip Bump in The Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/27/americas-favorite-dog-breeds-for-the-past-two-decades-ranked/However, there is another important piece of information in Preethi Lodha’s graph, which is the dollar amount spent by each generation for each expenditure category. This is presented within each point and is undoubtedly important if one wants to know how spending is distributed; however, that oscillation is not displayed with any other visual mark and can be misleading. This point will be discussed later.\nWhat can be seen here? Encodings, channels and strengths\nThere are 14 spending categories represented on the Y axis and 5 generations or age ranges showed on the X axis, above the graph and below the title and subtitle, from the Silent generation (the oldest) to the Generation Z.\nAccording to Cleveland (1985), graphs encode data in distinct elements, such as symbols, colors, position, etc. When we study a graphic we perform several mental-visual tasks to extract quantitative information. Some of the basic judgements we perform to decode quantitative information are 1) angle, 2) area, 3) color hue, 4) color saturation, 5) density, 6) length, 7) position along a common scale, 8) position along identical, nonaligned scales, 9) slope, and 10) volume (Cleveland 1985).\nIn consideration of this, the information in the bump chart can be extracted by judgements of position along the vertical scale, which represents the spending categories; the color of each line, which represents the categories of expenditure; the position of each point on the X axis, which represents the generation; and the thickness of the lines, which represents the money spent in each category (the thicker the line the more money has been spent). The closeness of the dots stands for the closeness in the ranking positions. The size of the points does not represent anything.\nCleveland also discusses detection, which he qualifies as the most fundamental perception issue, because before executing any graphical perception task, we must be able to detect the graphical element (Cleveland 1985). Lodha’s bump chart does not show overlaps in the dots, which together with color and position is the most important symbol. The jumps in the ranking are well understood. In broad terms, the graphic is very readable, which is not the same as effective.\nReplication in R\nAn almost exact replica was created using ggplot2,\nThe libraries used were as follows:\n\n\n# Import libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse) # for data manipulation\nlibrary(ggplot2) # for data graphics.\nlibrary(ggtext) # provides markdown and HTML text rendering\nlibrary(grid) # for adding the two white lines at the top and bottom\n\n\nThen, the data was imported. As mentioned above, the data is only a PDF, so the values had to be transcribed manually. After that, we made some transformations.\n\n\ndf <- read_csv(\"data.csv\")\nhead(df)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 15\n  generation  housing healthcare  food trans…¹ cash_…² enter…³ insur…⁴\n  <chr>         <dbl>      <dbl> <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>   <dbl>\n1 silent        16656       7053  5487    5263    4045    2027    1213\n2 boomers       21273       6594  7651    9327    2876    3476    6309\n3 gen_X         26385       5550 10388   13956    2747    4694   11656\n4 millennials   24052       4026  8463   11052    1163    3457    9249\n5 gen_Z         15449       1354  5529    7929     760    1693    3871\n# … with 7 more variables: miscellaneous <dbl>, apparel <dbl>,\n#   personal_care <dbl>, education <dbl>, alcohol <dbl>,\n#   reading <dbl>, smoking <dbl>, and abbreviated variable names\n#   ¹​transportation, ²​cash_contributions, ³​entertainment, ⁴​insurance\n\n\n\n# Pivot longer, add ranks and order chronologically\ndf <- df %>%\n  pivot_longer(-generation, names_to = \"variables\", values_to = \"dollars\") %>%\n  group_by(generation) %>%\n  arrange(generation, desc(dollars)) %>%\n  mutate(ranking = row_number())\n\n# Manually renaming\ndf$generation[df$generation == \"silent\"] <- \"Silent\"\ndf$generation[df$generation == \"boomers\"] <- \"Boomers\"\ndf$generation[df$generation == \"gen_X\"] <- \"Generation X\"\ndf$generation[df$generation == \"millennials\"] <- \"Millennials\"\ndf$generation[df$generation == \"gen_Z\"] <- \"Generation Z\"\n\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"alcohol\"] <- \n  \"Alcoholic beverages\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"apparel\"] <- \n  \"Apparel and services\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"cash_contributions\"] <- \n  \"Cash contributions\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"education\"] <- \n  \"Education\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"entertainment\"] <- \n  \"Entertainment\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"food\"] <- \n  \"Food\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"entertainment\"] <- \n  \"Entertainment\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"healthcare\"] <- \n  \"Healthcare\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"housing\"] <- \n  \"Housing\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"insurance\"] <- \n  \"Personal insurance and pensions\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"miscellaneous\"] <- \n  \"Miscellaneous expenditures\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"personal_care\"] <- \n  \"Personal care products and services\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"reading\"] <- \n  \"Reading\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"smoking\"] <- \n  \"Tobacco products and smoking \\n supplies\"\ndf$variables[df$variables == \"transportation\"] <- \n  \"Transportation\"\n\n\n\n\n# Formatting the dollars' column\ndf$dollars <- format(df$dollars, big.mark=\",\", trim=TRUE)\n\ndf$dollars <- paste0(\"$\", df$dollars)\n\n\nCharacter vectors were created to 1) sort the generation names chronologically because ggplot2 displayed them in alphabetical order, 2) format them in HTML language that will later be rendered by the ggtext package, and 3) to add as tag the description of the X-axis.\n\n\nx_names_ordered <- c(\"Silent\", \n                     \"Boomers\", \n                     \"Generation X\", \n                     \"Millennials\", \n                     \"Generation Z\")\n\n\n\n\nx_names_full = c(\n  \n  paste(\"<span style='font-size: 9.55pt'>**Silent**<\/span>\",\n        \"1945 or earlier\",\n        \"**$44,683**\",\n        sep = \"<br>\"),\n  \n  \n  paste(\"<span style='font-size: 9.55pt'>**Boomers**<\/span>\",\n        \"1946 to 1964\",\n        \"**$62,203**\",\n        sep = \"<br>\"),\n\n\n  paste(\"<span style='font-size: 9.55pt'>**Generation X**<\/span>\",\n        \"1965 to 1980\",\n        \"**$83,357**\",\n        sep = \"<br>\"),\n  \n  \n  paste(\n    \"<span style='font-size: 9.55pt'>**Millennials**<\/span>\",\n    \"1981 to 1996\",\n    \"**$69,061**\",\n    sep = \"<br>\"),\n  \n  \n  paste(\n    \"<span style='font-size: 9.55pt'>**Generation Z**<\/span>\",\n    \"1997 or later\",\n    \"**$41,636**\",\n    sep = \"<br>\")\n\n                )\n\n\n\n\nx_lab <- paste(\n  \"<span style='font-size: 10pt'>**Generation**<\/span>\",\n  \"Birth Year Range\",\n  \"**Average Annual Expenditure**\",\n  sep = \"<br>\"\n              )\n\n\nThen the theme was built. We call this theme theme_bump. Before that, we saved as objects the codes of the two main colors: the one of the background and the one of the text.\n\n\n# Colors\ncolor_background <- \"#e5d9cf\"\ncolor_text <- \"#333333\"\n\n\nThe textual elements were changed from element_text to element_markdown of the ggtext package.

Since these are interactive elements in the original dashboard, we did not consider it necessary.\nOriginal bump chart created by Preethi Lodha.My replica in ggplot2.How can it be improved? Enhancements\nFrom the start, one might question the need to design a graphic to display these data. Tufte (2013) points out that “[t]ables usually outperform graphics in reporting on small data sets of 20 numbers or less” and that “[t]he special power of graphs comes in the display of large data sets.” This case is not a large data set: in fact, the source is a PDF. This peculiarity has pros and cons: on the one hand, to represent expenditure by generation and expenditure category, it is unnecessary to perform many transformations; but on the other hand, it limits the options for alternative graphics.\nIn terms of features, notwithstanding its goodness, it is noted that this bump chart —and indeed, all of them— give readers the feeling that the difference between each category is about the same because the channels used —width of the lines and distance between them— are the same. Although in this case the thickness of the lines has been manipulated to represent each amount of money, its effect in counteracting that feeling is limited.\nUsing labels within the circles to show the money spent per category and per generation could have been a wise move, following the postulates of Tufte (2013), who points that “[c]lear, detailed and thorough labeling should be used to avoid graphic distortion and ambiguity […].” But, in this case, such labels add an extra layer of information and if the bump chart represents jumps in ranking, these were already encoded in the position of the dots and the jumps in the lines. Moreover, there are examples that even though spending in a certain category decreases from one generation to the next, its position in the ranking goes up and vice versa: just look at the jump from Millennials to Generation Z in the category Personal care products and services; and the jump from Boomers to Generation X in the Food category. Tufte himself would call it “a lying graphic” (Tufte 2013).\n\n“A second defense of the lying graphic is that, although the design itself lies, the actual numbers are printed on the graphic for those picky folks who want to know the correct size of the effects displayed. […]” (Tufte 2013)\n\nSo, if the purpose is to represent the spending distribution of Americans, showing rankings can be misleading. For this reason, the main point of improvement would be to represent spending rather than ranking. This implies to change the type of graph to one where the data items are the money spent and the data attributes are the generation and the category of spending. Tufte (2013), in this regard, postulates that “[t]he representation of numbers, as physically measured on the surface of the graph itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented” (Tufte 2013). What visual marks would be the most efficient?\nIn order to continue using lines and dots to represent the data, the proposed enhancements are in a line plot:\nA line plot based on Preethi Lodha’s bump chart. This enhancements proposal also has much room for improvement in concept and implementation. Own elaboration.This is not exempt from problems, both in terms of conception and execution. First, the category with the highest expenditure by far is Housing, but the other categories are very close, which caused problems with overlapping labels. That was the driving force behind plotting only the first 6 expenditure categories. Even so, overlapping continued to exist and the ggrepel package, which would help to solve it, did not really avoid them; it only helped to eliminate the labels that were too close at the cost of dislocating others. Another problem is that, according to Healy (2018), lines illustrate “connection and common fate in that the lines joining the shapes tend to be read left-to-right as part of a series” (Healy 2018). He mentions this when explaining Gestalt rules, which are “the strong inferences we make about relationships between visual elements from relatively sparse visual information.” The author emphasizes that line graphs suggest that the underlying variable is continuous and that is not necessarily advantageous for our data, since the X axis contains the generations, but it is not a continuous variable over time.\nThe Gestalt inferences. Extracted from: Data vizualization: a practical introduction, by Kieran Healy. Published by the author in https://socviz.co/One option was to make a Sankey diagram. These visualize flows of quantities through a process and, as an opinion, are more eye-catching. With a Sankey diagram, we would have split the amount spent by each generation in 2021 into 14 categories of data —or fewer, if we also decide to show only the top categories or to group several ones into “Others”—, and each generation would be a breakdown. However, this would give the false sense that the flow of money changes over a period of time and, in stricto sensu, it is not: spending does not change over time: all the data represented is from 2021. What does change is another categorical variable: generation.\nAn example of a Sanky diagram from Wikimedia Commons:\nWikimedia Commons.In addition, in data visualization, clarity should be privileged over the pomposity: Healy (2018) quotes Tufte about graphical excellence, commenting that it “consists of complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.” Thus, the idea of a Sankey, despite being relatively simple to execute with the ggsankey package, was discarded. A cleaner, clearer and closer option to Lodha’s original graph is the line plot.\nDesigning the enhancements proposal\n\n\n#Libraries, most of them already used in the replica\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(ggrepel) # To (try to) avoid label overlappings\n\n\nThe following pipes were useful for obtaining a suitable dataframe:\n\n\ndf <- read_csv(\"data.csv\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(-generation, \n               names_to = \"variables\", \n               values_to = \"dollars\") %>%\n  #group_by(generation) %>%\n  arrange(desc(dollars))\n\n\nThen, the data was manipulated.

These, although better, still have some flaws.\nThe design of an alternative graph with the same data involved a nonlinear flow. Cleveland explains that data graphing should be an iterative process: “Iteration and experimentation are important for all of data analysis, including graphical data display. Most times when we make a graph it is immediately [sic] clear that some aspect is inadequate and we regraph the data. In many other cases we make a graph, and all is well, but we get an idea for studying the data in a different way with a different graph; one successful graph often suggests another” (Cleveland 1985).\nThe purposes that the new graph should follow were to make the data stand out and eliminate superfluity (Cleveland 1985). Another important point is ease of understanding. Heer and Bostock (2010) replicated previous studies on graphical perception by evaluating charts that encoded data in different ways. Basically, the best way to represent data is with comparison on a common scale —such as grouped bar charts— and the worst is to show it in areas like treemaps do (these performed even worse than pie charts!) (Heer and Bostock 2010). Given this, the theory suggests simplicity, cleanliness and clarity rather than fancy design details and pomposity. In this case, we went for simplicity even in contradiction to Cleveland, who argues that “[t]he important criterion for a graph is not simply how fast we can see a result; rather, it is whether through the use of the graph we can see something that would have been harder to see otherwise […]” (1985). We believe that it is very important that the graphic shows its main idea at first glance, especially in these days when we have so many visual stimuli on the Internet and they all fight for our attention.\nThus, visual cleanliness is a must, but for those intended for publication in websites such as the Visual Capitalist that target a wide and not necessarily expert audience, it is also a challenge. In addition, there are also studies that suggest that visual embellishment has a positive effect on the comprehension and memorability of graphics (Bateman et al. 2010). How to balance aesthetic taste and graphical excellence and integrity? We had to achieve all this without creating a chartjunk, as Tufte would call it, and without losing the purpose of the data, of the original bump chart and its context, and with a data that is only a small table.\nFor these reasons, the safe bet was to develop a grouped bar chart that shows spending categories, generation and amounts in a clear, simple and uncluttered way, but with a custom theme.\nA grouped bar chart, colorblind-friendly. This is the proposed alternative visualization. Own elaboration.The underlying cause why it is flipped is mainly to avoid label overlappings, which were the major problem in all the visualizations we tried with this data. A colorblind-friendly color palette was made. Also, the grid was eliminated according to Tufte: “one of the most sedate graphical elements, the grid, should usually be muted or completely suppressed so that its presence is only implicit—lest it compete with the data […]. Dark grid lines are chartjunk” (Tufte 2013). We do not agree that much with him in that regard, but we must accept that, at least in this case, they are not necessary: that information is already provided by the labels, which Tufte endorses. The choice of font was a personal choice.\nThis graphic has, however, some flaws: we find that the number of bars make it look bloated even though we reduced their number by including several in the “Others” category.\nAlso, the presence of a legend is not bad per sé, but in this case there are still several categories and the audience would have to constantly go back and forth from the legend to the plot to decipher what represents which bar. However, positioning the name of each spending category instead of the name, birth year range and total spent would make it even more bloated.\nAs the display of multiple bars seemed a bit cluttered even if, in our opinion, the plot delivers the correct visualization, a similar visualization was made. We considered that a lollipop plot could be an even better option, and is a close relative of bar plots.\nA grouped lollipop, also colorblind-friendly. Own elaboration.Clarity was the guideline for this lollipop graphic, too. However, some drawbacks arose: the overlapping labels made us decide to remove any geom_text or geom_label from our code and, contravening Tufte, plot a grid as an alternative. Only minor grids are shown and we set a number of grids that we felt was not exaggerated. We also it dashed and used a very subtle color so that it does not overload the plot too much. Still, it exists.\nBoth plots, even if simple, show the expenses per generation more clearly than the bump chart and have visual encodings, according to Heer and Bostock (2010), capable of being better interpreted than stacked bar charts, bubble charts, pie charts and treemaps, the latter being even less effective than pie charts. This last case caught our attention, as treemaps are quite common in all types of publications and are, in our personal opinion, visually appealing. See here an example of a treemap published by Le Monde newspaper.\nSo, we made one, just for comparison (and learning how-to) purposes:\nA treemap just for clarity comparison. Authors argue that it is not a good option due that areas are hard to compare, even more than angles (like the case of pie charts). Own elaboration.As can be seen, the bar plot is simpler and easier to understand than the treemap, as it uses a single visual mark, the bar, to represent the data. That specific visual mark is always of the same width, so the viewer decodes only the height of the bar to interpret the quantity it encodes. For that reason, the proposed bar plot is more effective at conveying the patterns of the data and to compare the values of different categories.\nWhat cannot be denied about the treemap is that it is visually more attractive, at least to our personal taste. Unfortunately, with this one it is more complicated to interpret the differences in the money spent by each generation in a single category. For example, if there were no money spent labels added, it would be difficult to compare Generation X and Generation Z spending on Housing. Besides, it was way more difficult to design. We could have designed one treemap with 5 subgroups —and not 5 invidivual treemaps and then paste them— and the result would have been more or less similar, but without the spaces between each subgroup and with problems to add specific colors for each generation. The code is at the end of this report.\nDesigning the bar plot\n\n\n# Libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(grid)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n\nWe first computed the rankings just for the selecting the first categories.\n\n\ndf <- \n  read_csv(\"data.csv\") %>%\n  pivot_longer(-generation, \n               names_to = \"variables\", \n               values_to = \"dollars\") %>%\n  group_by(generation) %>%\n  arrange(generation, \n          desc(dollars)) %>%\n  mutate(ranking = row_number())\n\n# Rename categories lower in the ranking as \"Others\"\ndf$variables[df$ranking >= 8] <- \"Others\"\n\n#Aggregation in order to have all \"Others\" in the same row\ndf <- df %>%\n  group_by(generation, variables) %>%\n  summarise(dollars = sum(dollars))\n\n\nThen, the data was manipulated, and variables renamed.\n\n\n# Format the dollar column\n\ndf$dollars2 <- format(df$dollars, big.mark=\",\", trim=TRUE)\n\ndf$dollars2 <- paste0(\"$\",df$dollars2)\n\n\nA character vector for ordering the generations:\n\n\ngen_order <- c(\n  \"Generation Z\",\n  \"Millennials\",\n  \"Generation X\",\n  \"Boomers\",\n  \"Silent\"\n      )\n\n\nWe used the same colors:\n\n\n# Theme colours\ncolor_background <- \"#e5d9cf\"\ncolor_text <- \"#333333\"\n\n\nLater, the custom theme was built.

For that reason, the legend could not be displayed properly, so we made a very simple bar plot containing a legend, and the get_leyend function extracted it. Then, we converted it into an ggplot2 element with the as_ggplot function. This procedure allowed us to use the patchwork package and paste the 5 treemaps plus the legend. The ggpubr and cowplot packages were used for these purposes.\n\n\n# Summarize the spendings per generation\ndf_summ <- df %>%\n    group_by(generation) %>%\n    summarise(total_per_generation = sum(dollars))\n\n\n\n\ngen_order <- c(\"Silent\", \n       \"Boomers\", \n       \"Generation X\", \n       \"Millennials\", \n       \"Generation Z\")\n\n\n\n\n# Set custom colors\nbar_colors <- c(\"#9a7447\",\n                          \"#be7c4d\",\n                          \"#717342\",\n                          \"#c49350\",\n                          \"#897d65\"\n)\n\nbar2 <- ggplot(df_summ) +\n  aes(\n    x = generation,\n    fill = generation,\n    weight = total_per_generation) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_manual(breaks=gen_order, \n                    values = bar_colors,\n                    name = \"\",\n                    labels = c(\"**Silent**<br>1945 or earlier<br>**$44,683**\", \n                               \"**Boomers**<br>1946 to 1964<br>$**62,203**\", \n                               \"**Generation X**<br>1965 to 1980<br>**$83,357**\", \n                               \"**Millennials**<br>1981 to 1996<br>**$69,061**\", \n                               \"**Generation Z**<br>1997 or later<br>**$41,636**\")) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n    limits = gen_order) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0,0,0,0), \"pt\")) +\n  theme(legend.text = element_markdown(\n      color = color_text,\n      family = \"Consolas\",\n      size = 7, \n      hjust = 0.5)) + # top, right, bottom, left\n  theme(legend.title = element_markdown(\n      color = color_text,\n      family = \"Consolas\",\n      size = 7, \n      hjust = 0.5)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") +\n  theme(legend.spacing.x = unit(0.5, 'cm'))\n\nbar2\n\n\n\n\n\n# Extract the legend\nlegend_extract <- get_legend(bar2) \n\n\n\n\n# Turn the legend into a ggplot2 object\nlegend <- as_ggplot(legend_extract)\n\n\nPaste all graphics:\n\n\ntree <- legend + ((silent / boomers) | (x / millennials) + z) + \n  plot_layout(\n              nrow = 2,\n              ncol = 1,\n              heights = c(0.5, 6)) +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \n      paste(\"<span style='color: #3d2309; font-size: 15pt'>\",\n            \"_Housing_: more than 30% of Americans' expenditures in 2021\",\n            \"<\/span>\",\n            sep = \"\"),\n    \n    subtitle = \n      paste(\"<span style='color: #4e4b4b; font-size: 10pt'>\",\n            \"It was the top spending category across all generations in 2021.<br>\",\n            \"Overall, _Gen X_ spent the most ($83,357), followed by _Millennials_ ($69,091).\",\n            \"<\/span>\",\n            sep = \"\"\n            ),\n    \n    caption = \"Carolina Cornejo Castellano | Data: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\",\n    theme = theme_tree()\n                  )\n\ntree\n\n\n\nSave plot:\nggsave(\"alternative_tree.png\", \n       plot = last_plot(), \n       path = \"images\", \n       width = 8.29, \n       height = 6.88, \n       units = \"in\", \n       dpi = 300)\nNeedless to say, replicating the graphic and proposing new visualizations were very learning exercises.

When the State´s budget is published, almost the first thing that each media do is to analyze what are the communities that receive more, and what are the ones that receive less. This could be important, because depending on the needing of support for the governance, more money would go to one community or another.\nThe point here, is in the differences between Madrid and Catalonia. However, as illustrated here, the budget from Catalonia is closer to Andalusia rather than Madrid. We can see notices of this kind in the national press channel “Catalonia and Andalusia lead state investment with almost twice the budget of Madrid and the Valencian Community” or the “El Mundo” from which I took the graph.\nJ.Aguirre | EL MUNDO GRÁFICOS. Figure from elmundo.es.Getting the data\nApparently, the data could be really easy to obtain from an official source, because if you observe this same data from different papers, figures vary a bit. But, as expected with public institutions, the process is really tedious. So, what I did is to obtain the data from the public institution in charge of this figures in Spain, La Intervención General de la Administración del Estado with data from 2009 to 2022.\nFor data about the budget for the next year, 2023, I used another official page which show the information in a visual way, Ministerio de Hacienda, epdata.\nOnce you get the file with the whole datasheet from one specific year, you have to sum the different budget items by communities. It appears spread by different concepts, as a page in an excel book and repeating the process for the four years. Having done that, it is possible to obtain the data in a .cvs file format. So, we will see how our data looks like:\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggsci)\nlibrary(ggforce)\nlibrary(glue)\nlibrary(systemfonts)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Be Vietnam Pro\")\nshowtext::showtext_opts(dpi=300)\n\ndata<- read_delim(\"Clean_Data.csv\", delim = \";\", col_types = \"cnnnn\"  )\nglimpse(data)\n\nRows: 19\nColumns: 5\n$ Comunidad <chr> \"Andalucia\", \"Cataluña\", \"Com. de Madrid\", \"C.

But for observing the main measures of central tendency from our data and its evolution through this for years, it would be nice to include the summary () function.\n\n\nsummary(data)\n\n  Comunidad              2018             2021        \n Length:19          Min.   :  23.5   Min.   :  24.48  \n Class :character   1st Qu.: 195.3   1st Qu.: 216.80  \n Mode  :character   Median : 363.9   Median : 384.10  \n                    Mean   : 504.7   Mean   : 622.11  \n                    3rd Qu.: 797.4   3rd Qu.: 795.90  \n                    Max.   :1379.7   Max.   :2199.30  \n      2022              2023       \n Min.   :  31.85   Min.   :  28.9  \n 1st Qu.: 192.60   1st Qu.: 241.4  \n Median : 439.30   Median : 481.5  \n Mean   : 666.25   Mean   : 718.1  \n 3rd Qu.: 984.35   3rd Qu.:1016.9  \n Max.   :2430.74   Max.   :2508.9  \n\nOnce we have our raw data, it is time to start giving format to our variables, in order that they appear specifically how we want them, not as mere values in a table.\n\n\ndata<-data %>% \n  pivot_longer(c(\"2018\", \"2021\", \"2022\", \"2023\")) %>% \n  mutate(\n    Comunidad=as.factor(Comunidad),\n    name=as.factor(name),\n  )\n\n\nFirst thing to do is to mutate them as a long format, which is more useful for visualization and statistics approaches. Also, it is important to convert the name of the communities and the name of the year, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2018, as factors. That is the way that we have in R to specify the categories in the representation.\nNow, it is possible to say that our data seems to be what it would be expected to start the construction of the graph.\nBuilding the chart\nThe plot was selected because it could seem easy to reproduce, and was the first time dealing with this kind of representation on my own. However, it started to get harder and harder to deal with this grouped bar chart, and the small details were really time consuming. But finally, it was possible to come up with a result as could be seen in the following lines:\nCoordinates and axes\nI will try to reproduce the graph, step by step, before adding the data and obtaining the whole plot.\n\n\np <- ggplot(data) +\n  aes(x=Comunidad, y=value)\n\np\n\n\n\nWith this first chunk of code, the baseline of the plot appears. Based on which, we will be adding information and modifying the different characteristic, in order to satisfy the same specification as in the selected one. However, the names of the communities are all together and it is really difficult to understand. It is a pointless point, so it´s worth it to have a vertical disposition instead of a horizontal one, the categories would be more readable.\nAs it could be seen in the example, the graph has certain limits for the values of our data. One of the first points that we have to do, is to fix those values within the specific categories. In this case from 0 to 3000 in steps of 500. I decided to expand the limits a bit more than this 3000, because otherwise the label for this 3000 extended passed the axis and we could not see it.\nThere are also coordinates for the negative part of the graph despite not having negative information for the budgets. That is because we have to extend the lines and add the names of the communities in this part as annotations, otherwise it would be impossible.\nA good point to highlight here, and which was really hard to find, is how to set the y axis on both sides. Although it is a simple line of code, it took me a while to find this specific chunk of code, so if some of you need this in the future pay attention at this point, because the rest is more or less the same as in all plots.\n\n\np <- p + scale_y_continuous(\n    breaks = c(0, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000),\n    limits = c(-1500, 3200),\n    sec.axis = dup_axis(),\n    name = NULL,\n    expand = c(0,0)\n  ) +\n  \n  scale_x_discrete(\n    name = NULL,\n    limits = c(\"Ceuta\", \"Melilla\", \"La Rioja\", \"Navarra\", \"Baleares\", \n               \"Cantabria\", \"Canarias\", \"Asturias\", \"Extremadura\", \n               \"Murcia\", \n               \"Aragón\", \"País Vasco\", \"Castilla-La Mancha\", \n               \"Castilla y León\", \"Galicia\", \"C. Valenciana\", \n               \"Com. de Madrid\", \"Andalucia\", \"Cataluña\"),\n    labels = NULL,\n    expand = c(0,0)\n  )\n\np\n\n\n\nA last comment about this previous chunk. The names of the axis have been deleted, because we do not want it to appear in our last graph, but also, we set a specific order for the name of the communities, based on the highest budget for the year 2023.\nTheme\nThe theme for this project is very easy. As it can be seen, the background of the graph is empty, nothing inside, but for, the lines below the name of each community which separate one community from another. A key point here is that we have established the small tick that appears below each break. Maybe, in this position it is hard to identify, but once we apply for coord_flip() it is more easy to observe.\n\n\np <- p + theme_minimal()+\n  \n  theme(\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks.x.top = element_line(\n      size = .5, colour = \"#696969\"), \n    axis.ticks.x.bottom = element_line(\n      size = .5, colour = \"#696969\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(color=\"#ffffff\", fill=\"#ffffff\"),\n    plot.margin = margin(5,5,5,5))\n    \np\n\n\n\nWe have an empty graph, with nothing inside which is the case that we are trying to replicate. However, we need to add the guides, and coord_flip() to see something similar to the original one. So, we will do it.\n\n\np <- p +  coord_flip(clip = \"off\", ylim = c(-1500, 3100))+\n  geom_segment(\n    data = data.frame(x = seq(1.5, 18.5, 1), ymin =-1500, ymax = 3100),\n    aes(x = x, xend = x, y = ymin, yend = ymax),\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    color = \"#8e8e8e\"\n  )\n\np\n\n\n\nInstead of having a vertical bar chart which is the usual scenario after applying for these changes, we have a horizontal plot, with nothing inside. The graph is starting to seem similar to the original one. However, it is a kind of graph that by its nature, it is much longer than wider, so we have to change the adjustment of our R.Markdown to obtain what we want.\nNotice, that we have changed the specification of the graph, the plot is more or less what we want. Now is the time to add the data and the annotations.\nAnnotations\nApparently, this graph does not have any kind of annotation. However, it is a bit misleading and there was no other way to add the name of the communities rather than as an annotation. To do so, what I did is to extend the dimension of the plot past the axis, and once we have that, adding in the negative part the name corresponding to the different communities as annotations.\n\n\np <- p + annotate(\"text\", x = 19, y = -1400, hjust=0, \n           label = \"Cataluña\", size = 3, \n           colour = \"#262626\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 18, y = -1400, hjust=0, \n           label = \"Andalucia\", size = 3,\n           colour = \"#262626\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 17, y = -1400, hjust=0,  \n           label = \"Com. de Madrid\", size = 3,\n           colour = \"#262626\")+\n  annotate(\"text\", x = 16, y = -1400, hjust=0, \n           label = \"C.

With the name of the different communities and their budget from four different years, that is why in the previous steps it was important to pivot longer the data, and establish the different year and communities as_factor(). So, it is the type of grouped bar chart.\nNow, we will add the data to the previous coordinates and axis that we have been preparing, but also we will establish the different colors of the bars.\n\n\np <- p + \n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", stat = \"identity\", width = 0.63) + \n  aes(fill = name) +\n  scale_fill_manual(breaks=c(\"2023\",\"2022\",\"2021\", \"2018\"), \n                    values = c(\"#ff1e26\", \"#5f9dc6\",   \"#8ccaf9\", \"#c5daeb\"))\n\np\n\n\n\nThe graph it is closer to our final result. Few things are still left such as a good title, subtitle and caption. But also, we have to establish a good position for the legend which is almost higher than the plot, and this does not make any sense.\nLabs\nA key point that it is still missing in this graph are the labs. If we see the graph until this point, we do not know what the graph is about without an appropriate title, it is mandatory to modify it, and also adding the different subtitles and comments.\n\n\np <- p + \n  labs(\n    title = \"EL REPARTO DE LA INVERSIÓN ESTATAL POR CCAA\",\n    subtitle = \"INVERSIÓN REAL \\n\\n\\n\",\n    caption = \"Se añaden 20,52 millones de euros para Ceuta y Melilla \\n\",\n    fill = \"En millones de euros\")\n\n\nHowever, when we add all of these things, our plot is completely a mess, because we have added many different things, without the necessary adjustment. So, everything has moved from one place to another and appears to be untidy. Let´s try to solve it! Basically, we will be adjusting almost every position of the element on the plot.\n\n\np <- p + \n  theme(\n    axis.title.x = element_text(hjust=.5, color=\"black\", \n                                size=10, face = \"bold\", \n                                margin = margin(10,0,0,0)),\n    axis.text = element_text(color=\"black\", \n                             size=8 ),\n     axis.text.y = element_text(color=\"black\",\n                               size=10),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust=-0, size=11, \n                              color=\"black\",lineheight=.8, face=\"bold\", \n                              margin=margin(0,0,0,0)),\n     plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0, vjust = 1.2, \n                                  size=9.5, color= \"black\", \n                                  face = \"bold\", margin=margin(10,0,10,0)),\n    plot.caption = element_text(hjust= -0.05,margin=margin(10,0,0,0), \n                                size=8, color=\"black\", face=\"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.caption.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \np\n\n\n\nLegend\nHowever, we still have the legend in a position that modifies the whole graph, and we have to change that to obtain a real reproduction.\n\n\np<- p +\n  theme(\n    legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n    legend.position = c(0.285, 1.05), \n    legend.margin = margin(0),\n    legend.title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    legend.text = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 8),\n    legend.spacing.x = unit(0.09, 'cm'),\n    legend.key.size = unit(0.6, \"cm\"),\n    legend.key.height= unit(0.3, 'cm'),\n    legend.key.width = unit(0.65, \"cm\"),\n    legend.spacing.y = unit(0.1,'cm')\n    ) +\n  guides(fill= guide_legend(title.position = \"top\", title.hjust = 0))\np\n\n\n\nOnce we have done that, the representation is consistent with what we want, because everything is adjusted and aligned, not as in the previous steps, that when you modify something everything changes and you have to start again. But never give up, you will finish doing it!\nIt is time to introduce the annotation near to the name of each community. I tried to do it at the same time in just one chunk of code, but only the names from 3 different communities and the other disappeared. I do not know the reason well. So that is why I decided to do it step by step although it is longer. Sure, there is a better option.\nAnd also we have to add a little more. Notice that at the bottom of the graph there is more information than just a simple caption, so we have to add also this information. The way that I found better to add this information is by using the ggdraw(), which will be included at the end of the next chunk.\n\n\np<- p +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"2508.9\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"2318.8\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"1305.4\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1, \n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"1269.5\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"1077.9\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"955.8\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"600.7\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"558.8\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"547.9\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"481.5\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"473.9\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  )+\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"420.9\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"391.9\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"296.6\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"186.3\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = - 0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"103.8\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"71.3\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) + \n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"45.3\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label= ifelse(value == c(\"28.9\"), value, NA)), \n    position = position_dodge(0.8),\n    hjust = -0.1,\n    vjust = 0.75, size = 2.8,\n    colour = \"#262626\"\n  )\n\np <- ggdraw(add_sub(p, \"Fuente:PGE 2023, 2022, 2021 Y 2018 \\nP.Arroyo | MUCSS\", \n                    y = 0.8, x = -0.01, hjust = 0, vjust = 0.85, size = 7.8, \n                    color = \"black\", lineheight = 0.85))\n\np\n\n\n\nImprovements\nThe plot that I decided to reproduce, was quite complete with almost all the elements that should be included for a good representation, such as: a nice axis with its reference, annotations of different values, a clear legend, nice colors and so on.\nHowever, as a reader of newspapers I miss an interesting point that all graphs should have, something that draws our attention and keeps us reading the notice. This could be done by introducing some interesting point, or maybe some controversial that keeps readers awake, that is why I decided to do the following graph:\nP.Arroyo | MUCSS.Mainly, I decided to do two thing:\nAdding the name of the policy party that is in charge of each community.\nIncluding the evolution of the budget per community with an ascending or descending arrow.\nBy doing that, we include some controversial questions that encourage readers to go deeper in the theme. That is because, as said in the introduction, in Spain it is believed by many people that the budget that each community receives depends on sympathy with the central government.\nWhat, surprised me when I was doing this tutorial, is that also the original author of the previous graph, Javier Aguirre, has introduced some modifications in line with the ones that I was doing. The idea was the same, but his ones were more visual so I decided to continue my path in that way because it was just a few lines of code and the appearance was better. “See news with the final graph” This is a good point to remark, that once you get a nice graph, there is always a way to improve it based on the previous one.\nI have to point out that I don’t like in his definitive graph the inclusion of the top X axis, because there is so much information in the positive part that you will end up missing.\nCode\nI want to comment on the key point that I made to modify the whole graph. Also, I know that a good point of improvement is reducing the code to reproduce exactly the same, by for example using sequences that is something that I would like to do in future steps.\nMain points to highlight:\nExtending the limits of the axis passed the data, from -1500 to 4500, to introduce the different elements as annotations.\nSelecting just one X axis for reference instead of dup_axis(), in order not to overload the plot.\nCompute the percentage variation and add the different elements as annotations in this new axis.\nNevertheless, I include the whole chunk of code, knowing as I said before that there is enough space to do it in fewer lines, but the first step is a nice way of starting.\n\n\n### Coordinates and axes\nt <- ggplot(data) +\n  aes(x=Comunidad, y=value)\n\nt <- t + scale_y_continuous(\n  breaks = c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000),\n  #sec.axis = dup_axis(),\n  name = NULL,\n  expand = c(0,0)\n) +\n  scale_x_discrete(\n    name = NULL,\n    limits = c(\"Ceuta\", \"Melilla\", \"La Rioja\", \"Navarra\", \n               \"Baleares\", \"Cantabria\", \"Canarias\", \"Asturias\", \n               \"Extremadura\", \"Murcia\", \"Aragón\", \"País Vasco\", \n               \"Castilla-La Mancha\", \"Castilla y León\", \"Galicia\", \n               \"C.

However, China’s Zero-Covid policy has stilted growth significantly. The “China Emerging City Rankings, 2022” Report, launched by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), assesses the growth potential of 108 cities predicted to have a population of more than 1 million by 2025. Scores are calculated using historical data and forecasts on variables including demography, the local economy or the environment.\nThe Economist’s “March of the cities” map. Figure from economist.com.This post will seek to replicate this map, propose incremental enhancements and suggest an alternative visualization that depicts the relationship between growth potential, population and location (or distance to the coastline) taking cities as our units of analysis.\nThe original chart\nObtaining and processing the data\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(showtext)\nlibrary(maps)\nlibrary(maptools)\nlibrary(svglite)\nlibrary(plyr)\n\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"IBM Plex Sans\", family=\"IBM Plex Sans\")\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\n\nDiving into data collection, we obtained the data on the ranking and population of our units of analysis from the EIU (‘Global Geo-Political Trends and Economics’ section) after contacting their office in Asia by email.\n\n\nranking <- read_csv(\"ranking.csv\")\npopulation <- read_csv(\"population.csv\")\n\n\nOnce we have loaded both sets of data, the summaries below show that the ‘ranking’ dataset contains data on scores for 106 cities (ordered from highest, i.e. Ranking = 1, to lowest) while the ‘population’ dataset includes population data for 397 cities in China.\n\n\nglimpse(ranking)\n\nRows: 106\nColumns: 2\n$ City    <chr> \"Hangzhou\", \"Shenzhen\", \"Shanghai\", \"Suzhou\", \"Guang…\n$ Ranking <dbl> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 1…\n\nglimpse(population)\n\nRows: 397\nColumns: 2\n$ City       <chr> \"Shanghai\", \"Beijing\", \"Shenzhen\", \"Guangzhou\", \"…\n$ Population <dbl> 22315474, 18960744, 17494398, 16096724, 13568357,…\n\nIn order to get both attributes (“Ranking” and “Population”) on the same dataset, we used a left_join to merge both datasets by the unit of analysis (“City”). This produced a dataset with both variables for the 106 cities provided by the EIU. Please note that, while the original map in the article by ‘The Economist’ includes 108 cities, the EIU only provided us with data on 106.\n\n\noutput <- ranking %>% left_join(population, by=\"City\")\n\n\nIn order to obtain the “longitude” and “latitude” of each city, we used the world.cities database. This database includes these and other variables for over 40,000 cities in the world. We then filtered the cities in China and selected (as well as renamed) the variables of interest to later on construct my final database.\n\n\ndata <- world.cities %>%\n  filter(country.etc==\"China\") %>%\n  dplyr::select(name, lat, long) %>%\n  dplyr::rename(\"City\"=\"name\", \n         \"Latitude\"=\"lat\", \n         \"Longitude\"=\"long\") \n\n\nWe then merged the location dataset (‘data’) and the dataset with information on ranking and location (‘output’).\n\n\nfulloutput <- output %>% left_join(data, by=\"City\")\n\n\nThe data also required some cleaning and adjustment. First, there were two cities with the same name (i.e. Suzhou) in the EIU ranking. Since they are located in different provinces, we used population and location data to cross check which city corresponded to which score provided by the EIU and renamed one of them to establish the difference. Second, there were several other cities in the ‘data’ dataset with the same name as cities in the ‘output’ one, which led to there being more than one row for each unit of analysis in the ‘fulloutput’ table. We removed the appropriate rows, as well as the rows for which latitude and longitude data were not available (i.e. NAs for those variables). We are left with 104 rows.\n\n\nfulloutputclean <- fulloutput[-c(5, 23, 49, 51, 70, 81, 104, 113),]\nfulloutputclean <- fulloutputclean[!is.na(fulloutputclean$Latitude) \n                                   & !is.na(fulloutputclean$Longitude), ]\nhead(fulloutputclean, 5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 5\n  City      Ranking Population Latitude Longitude\n  <chr>       <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>\n1 Hangzhou        1    9236032     30.2      120.\n2 Shenzhen        2   17494398     22.5      114.\n3 Shanghai        3   22315474     31.2      121.\n4 Suzhou          4    6715559     31.3      121.\n5 Guangzhou       5   16096724     23.1      113.\n\nThe final step in data processing was obtaining the data to plot the underlying map of China and its provinces. The ggplot2-china-map repository contains such information. We used the readOGR function to read the ‘shapefile’, cleaned the data and fortified into a dataframe. We then instructed that the islands in the South China Sea not be drawn by selecting only observations with “AREA” above 0.005. Finally, again, we renamed variables accordingly.\n\n\nchina <- rgdal::readOGR(dsn=(\"./china_shapefile/\"), layer=\"bou2_4p\", verbose=FALSE)\nchina@data$id<-rownames(china@data)\nchina.points<-fortify(china, region=\"id\")\nchina.df<-join(china.points, china@data, by=\"id\")\nchina<-subset(china.df, AREA>0.005) %>% \n  dplyr::rename(\"Latitude\"=\"lat\", \n         \"Longitude\"=\"long\",\n         \"Grouping\"=\"group\")\n\n\nBuilding the plot\nCoordinates of the map and data points\nUsing the data loaded in ‘china’ in the last step, we use geom_polygon() to draw the underlying map. The aes argument maps the longitude and latitude columns to the x and y coordinates, respectively. This function is also used to specify the fill and the transparency (alpha) level of the map.\nWe then use geom_path() to set the line demarcating the province limits. After indicating the use of the same variables and the same dataset as for the geom_polygon() function, we set the color and size of the border.\nFurther, coord_map() sets the coordinate system for the map by projecting the defined portion of the Earth onto a flat 2D plane.\n\n\np <- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data=china,\n            aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, group=Grouping),\n            fill=\"cornsilk3\",\n            alpha=0.3) +\n  geom_path(data=china, aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, group=Grouping),\n            color=\"white\",\n            size=0.2) +\n  coord_map() \np\n\n\n\nNext, we add the data points at the specific locations of the 104 cities (defined by their latitude and longitude) with geom_point(). Thus, on top of the map, we are plotting a scatterplot using data from ‘fulloutputclean’ where each point represents one city. The size of the point (more specifically, its area) represents its population and its fill depicts the relative position of a given city vis-à-vis other cities in the EIU ranking. We then set a black line around the point (shape=21) while specifying the color and thickness (stroke) of the border.\nA title, subtitle and caption are added to replicate the original chart using the labs function.\n\n\np2 <- p + \n  geom_point(data=fulloutputclean, \n             aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, size=Population, fill=Ranking), \n             shape=21,\n             color=\"black\",\n             stroke=0.03) +\n  labs(title=\"March of the cities\",                                                                   \n       subtitle=\"China, emerging city ranking, 2022\",\n       caption=\"Source: EIU\") \np2\n\n\n\nScales\nNext, the scale_fill_stepsn() and scale_size() functions are used to customize the appearance of the legends for the color and size aesthetics, respectively.\nFor the color legend (or rather, fill legend, given our points have borders defined by the color argument as introduced in the previous section), we first specify its title and title position. We then specify the details relating to the ticks and limits between the different boxes of the legend. We set the values for the 7 breaks in the variable ‘Ranking’ so as to create six categories of rank scores. By means of a drawing tool using the hexadecimal system, we set the colors for each of the six categories. Note that higher-ranked cities are represented with shades of blue and lower-ranked cities are represented with shades of orange or brown, whereby darker shades of both colors represent the ends of the spectrum.\nFor the size legend, we do the same as with the fill legend regarding the title and the breaks, although this time we are specifying 3 breaks. In this case we are also setting the labels for those breaks. This is because, by default, R uses scientific notation for population but the legend title already states that values are provided in millions. Finally, we set the range of the size of the bubbles from 0.04 to 6 mm.\n\n\np3 <- p2 + \n  scale_fill_stepsn(\n      guide=guide_colorsteps(title=\"Rank\",\n                             title.position=\"top\",\n                             ticks=TRUE, \n                             show.limits=TRUE, \n                             ticks.colour= \"black\",\n                             ticks.linewidth = 1, \n                             draw.llim=TRUE,\n                             draw.ulim=TRUE,\n                             order=1),\n      breaks=c(1, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 106), \n      colors=c(\"#1c2c74\", \"#5483b3\", \"#99ccff\", \"#fcdb9b\", \"#fcbc04\", \"#ac6404\"),\n      space=\"Lab\") +\n  scale_size(\n      guide=guide_legend(title=\"Population, 2020, m\", \n                         title.position=\"top\",\n                         order=2),\n      breaks=c(1000000, 10000000, 20000000),\n      labels=c(\"1\", \"10\", \"20\"),\n      range=c(0.04, 6))\np3\n\n\n\nTheme\nDespite there being a special ‘The Economist’ theme, a completely empty theme (without the default background and axis elements) is what we want. Hence we use theme_void(). Under the theme() function, we first specify the (previously loaded) font most closely resembling the one used in the original map. Concerning title, subtitle and caption, we specify their size, as well as their vertical (vjust) and horizontal justification (hjust). Also using the helping function element_text(), we instruct that the title be bold and the caption have the color “gray”. We then set the position, direction and justification of the legend so that it is horizontal and gets centered to the north of China (approximately where Mongolia would be). We then specify that both legends be left-justified and set the font size for both the title and the text inside the legend (as well as the face in the case of the legend title). Finally, we customize the margins around the legend area and set the key width to 8mm, the key height to 2.5mm and the spacing between keys in the size legend to 0.1mm.\n\n\np4 <- p3 +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(text=element_text(family=\"IBM Plex Sans\"),\n        plot.title=element_text(face=\"bold\", size=22, vjust=-8, hjust=0.05), \n        plot.subtitle=element_text(size=18, vjust=-10, hjust=0.058),\n        plot.caption=element_text(color = \"gray\", size = 17, hjust = 0.05),\n        legend.position=c(0.73, 0.96),\n        legend.direction=\"horizontal\",\n        legend.justification=c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n        legend.box.just=\"left\",\n        legend.title=element_text(face=\"bold\", size=14),\n        legend.text=element_text(size=14),\n        legend.margin=margin(1, 1, 1, 1),\n        legend.key.width=unit(8, \"mm\"),\n        legend.key.height=unit(2.5, \"mm\"),\n        legend.spacing.x=unit(0.1, 'mm'))\np4\n\n\n\nAnnotations\nThe last step to replicate the original map is the annotations, for which we use the annotate() function. While it may appear to be a caption, the text “1=best” is actually inside the plot and hence is introduced as an annotation. For this and the rest of annotations, we specify the type, the coordinates (x, y), the label, the size and the family (as well as the hjust, vjust, fontface and color for some).\nFor the textbox in the lower left corner in the original chart, we create a separate annotation for the title in order to be able to set its fontface to bold and assign it a different color. Further, we separate each of the five cities into different annotations as well because grouping them together under the same one led to there being too large of a vertical space between each of the five lines.\nFor the individual annotations of the eight highest ranked cities on their locations on the map, we simply use the coordinates for each city and adjust them to be able to see which point corresponds to each label. We also added separate annotations with the lines for five cities: Dongguan, Guangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing and Hangzhou (type= “segment”). These lines make identifying which label corresponds to each point easier when cities are clustered together.\n\n\np5 <- p4 + \n  annotate(\"text\", x=67, y=51.5, label=\"1=best\", \n           size=5.5, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=65, y=30, label=\"Highest ranked\", \n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\",\n           fontface=\"bold\", color=\"blue4\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=65, y=28, label=\"1  Hangzhou\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=65, y=26, label=\"2  Shenzhen\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=65, y=24, label=\"3  Shanghai\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=65, y=22, label=\"4  Suzhou\", \n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=65, y=20, label=\"5  Guangzhou\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=122, y=26, label=\"Hangzhou\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=116, y=21, label=\"Shenzhen\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=122, y=33, label=\"Shanghai\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=114, y=29, label=\"Suzhou\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=102, y=23, label=\"Guangzhou\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=116, y=41,label=\"Beijing\", \n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=123, y=29, label=\"Jiaxing\", \n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=110, y=26, label=\"Dongguan\",\n           size=5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=113, y=25.5, \n           xend=113, yend=24) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=110, y=23, \n           xend=112.5, yend=23) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=117, y=30, \n           xend=120, yend=31.5) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=123, y=29, \n           xend=121, yend=31) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=122, y=27, \n           xend=120, yend=30)\np5\n\n\n\nEvaluation and potential enhancements\nThis section starts with a brief discussion of the positive and negative qualities of both the original chart and its replication. First, there are several limitations with our reproduction of the map. First, we were not able to reproduce the curved segments joining Hangzhou and Suzhou with their respective points or bubbles as the chart did not support geom_curve(). We were also unable to imitate the appearance of the fill legend exactly as the one in the original map contains spaces between the different boxes or ranges of scores.\nNext, an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the original map is also necessary in order to suggest minor improvements.\nOverall, the original map is an effective visualization. The title and subtitle are concise and informative of its purpose and object, i.e. showing how, because of urbanization (“March of the cities”), cities of varying populations on the coast of China have different levels of growth potential as measured by a comprehensive score. The underlying map, which does not encode any information, does not distract from the information being shown as it is given a light color. Moreover, the legends are clear. This is especially important in the case of the size legend, which could be problematic since people perceive areas rather than radii as visual features in circles. In this case, the area of the circle seems to be proportional to population and so it correctly provides a reference point for readers to estimate the population of individual cities. The ‘expressiveness’ criterion is also met, as ordered data (“Ranking”) appears ordered by means of the hue scale. Finally, the annotations help readers focus on a small number of cities (eight for on-the-map annotations and five for the annotation on the bottom left corner), which facilitates the understanding of which cities have highest growth potential as well as of their characteristics (namely population and location).\nTherefore, the mapping of data into visual features communicates (and thus helps us understand) the “story” the author wants to tell in a clear, precise, efficient and truthful way.\nHowever, there may be some areas of potential improvement. The chart below includes several changes so as to enhance the ease of decoding visual information.\n\n\np <- ggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data=china, \n               aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, group=Grouping),\n               fill=\"cornsilk3\",\n               alpha=0.3) +   \n  geom_path(data=china, aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, group=Grouping), \n            color=\"white\", \n            size=0.2) +\n  coord_map(xlim=c(100, 155), ylim=c(20, 50)) +\n  geom_point(data=fulloutputclean,\n             aes(x=Longitude, y=Latitude, size=Population, fill=Ranking),\n             shape=21, color=\"black\") +       \n  labs(title=\"March of the cities\",\n       subtitle=\"Emerging city ranking, 2022\",\n       caption=\"Source: EIU\") +\n  scale_fill_stepsn(\n       guide=guide_colorsteps(title=\"Rank\",\n                             title.position=\"top\",\n                             ticks=TRUE,\n                             show.limits=TRUE,\n                             ticks.colour=\"black\",\n                             ticks.linewidth=1,\n                             draw.llim=TRUE,\n                             draw.ulim=TRUE,\n                             order=1), \n       colors=c(\"#00008b\", \"#6495ed\", \"#87cefa\", \"#e0ffff\"),\n       breaks=c(1, 30, 60, 90, 106),\n       space=\"Lab\") +\n  scale_size(\n       guide=guide_legend(title=\"Population, 2020, m\",\n                          title.position=\"top\",\n                          order=2), \n       breaks=c(1000000, 10000000, 20000000), \n       labels=c(\"1\", \"10\", \"20\"),\n       range=c(0.04, 6)) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(text=element_text(family=\"IBM Plex Sans\"),\n        plot.title=element_text(face=\"bold\", size=20, \n                                vjust=-14, hjust=0), \n        plot.subtitle=element_text(size=13, \n                                   vjust=-21, hjust=0),\n        plot.caption=element_text(color=\"gray\", size=14, \n                                  hjust=0),\n        legend.position=c(1.01, 1.01),\n        legend.direction=\"horizontal\",\n        legend.justification=c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n        legend.box.just=\"left\",\n        legend.box.background=element_rect(fill=\"white\"),\n        legend.margin=margin(5, 15, 5, 10),\n        legend.key.width=unit(12, \"mm\"),\n        legend.key.height=unit(3, \"mm\"),\n        legend.spacing.x=unit(0.1, 'mm'),\n        legend.title=element_text(face=\"bold\", size=14),\n        legend.title.align=0,\n        legend.text=element_text(size=14)) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=99, y=47.5, label=\"1=best\",\n           size=4.5, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=121, y=28, label=\"(1) Hangzhou\", \n           size=4.5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=115, y=21.5, label=\"(2) Shenzhen\", \n           size=4.5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=122, y=32, label=\"(3) Shanghai\",\n           size=4.5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=114.5, y=28, label=\"(4) Suzhou\", \n           size=4.5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=103, y=23, label=\"(5) Guangzhou\", \n           size=4.5, hjust=0, vjust=0, family=\"IBM Plex Sans\") +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=110.5, y=23, \n           xend=112.5, yend=23) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=123, y=29, \n           xend=121, yend=31) +\n  annotate(\"segment\", x=117.5, y=29, \n           xend=120, yend=31.5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=112, linetype=\"dashed\") \np\n\n\n\nAs suggested by the famous author in the field of visualization Edward Tufte, we should seek to maximize the data-ink ratio when displaying data. To that end, we should ask ourselves whether all elements (“ink”) in the chart are necessary to convey our message. Applying this notion to our map, we set limits for the coordinates through the arguments xlim and ylim inside the coord_map() function. This way, as seen in the map above, we “zoom in” to show the relevant data and remove the area west of meridian 100°. If we did this, we would only lose one observation (i.e. one city) and so it may be worth exploring this alternative. Since we have less “unused” space, we also set the legend background fill to “white” in order to establish a clear contrast between the legend and the map.\nMoreover, some changes to the fill legend may increase the ease of decoding visual information on ranking. In order to enhance discriminability on this scale, we reduce the number of categories from six to four. This way, it is easier for readers to figure out the order of cities according to their ranking and relate their scores to location and population without having to distinguish between too many values.\nAdditionally, despite being a small detail, the choice of the color palette may not be the most appropriate to depict this ordering. There does not seem to be an obvious reason for why stronger colors are assigned to the extremes in the ranking spectrum (i.e. highest- and lowest-ranked cities). Allocating different levels of saturation or lightness of the same hue could be an alternative way of visually conveying the ordering of cities according to growth potential. In the code above, we simply replace the colors for the original ‘40-60’ and ‘60-80’ categories with two lighter shades of blue under the scale_fill_stepsn()function.\nFurthermore, the fact that eight cities are annotated on the map and only five are included in the bottom left textbox is not too easy to realize at first and both annotations seem to include redundant information. By removing the textbox and adding the rank numbers directly to the cities annotated on the map, we simplify the visualization without removing essential information.\nFinally, in order to emphasize the idea that cities with the highest growth potential are on the coast, we might want to insert a vertical line (we use geom_vline()) at the (arbitrary) level of longitude 112°. This way we can see that among the 10 cities with the highest growth potential, only Chengdu (i.e. the “dark blue” bubble farthest west) is to the west of this longitude.\nAlternative visualization\nThe final section of this post proposes an alternative visualization to represent the relationship between the population, location and growth potential of cities in China. One possibility is the scatterplot shown below. We plot the ranking on the x-axis and population on the y-axis. We also use the geom_point() function just like in the original map.\nWe change the title and subtitle of the plot. We also add an informative caption and change the axis labels so as to make it even easier to understand what each variable represents and the message being conveyed. We alter the theme to theme_light() so as to increase the contrast between the background and the text and data points.\nThis time, by using the scale_y_continuous() function, we change the default scientific notation so that the axis itself shows population in ‘M’ (million). We then set the specifics for the font, title, subtitle, caption, axis title and axis text under the theme() function.\n\n\np <- ggplot(fulloutputclean) +\n  aes(x=Ranking, y=Population) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(title=\"Urbanization and economic growth in China\",      \n       subtitle=\"Emerging city ranking, 2022\",\n       caption=\"Coastal cities have highest growth potential\",\n       x=\"City Growth Ranking\",\n       y=\"City Population\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::label_number_si()) +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(text=element_text(family=\"IBM Plex Sans\"),\n        plot.title=element_text(face=\"bold\", size=26),                                                            \n        plot.subtitle=element_text(size=20),\n        plot.caption=element_text(size=20, hjust=0),\n        axis.title=element_text(size=15),\n        axis.text=element_text(size=13))\np\n\n\n\nIn general, we can see that higher growth potential (lower value for the variable “City Growth Ranking”) tends to be associated with a larger population, which was perhaps harder to see on the original map. However, we still need to include information about the location (coordinates) of cities. Within the location variable, it seems that longitude is the most important factor: cities closer to the coastline (i.e. farther east, or higher values of x) appear to have higher growth potential. These high-ranking cities seem to be distributed more or less evenly from north to south, hence we disregard the latitude information for simplicity. Therefore, we could encode longitude through the color of the points by highlighting in blue those points representing cities that are located east of the (again, arbitrarily chosen) 112° meridian. We also add a text label (on top of a white rectangle constructed with geom_rect()) to indicate that blue dots represent cities farther east in China.\n\n\nannotation <- dplyr::filter(fulloutputclean, Longitude>112)\np <- p + \n    geom_point(data=annotation, color=\"#6495ED\") +\n    geom_rect(aes(xmin=79, xmax=130, ymin=15000000, ymax=16600000),\n              fill=\"white\",\n              color = \"#6495ED\") +\n    geom_text(aes(x=80, y=15800000, \n                  label=\"Cities to the east of the 112th meridian\"),\n              size=6, hjust=0, vjust=0, color = \"#6495ED\")\np\n\n\n\nFinally, to highlight the top 5 cities from the original map, We construct another annotation and insert it as an argument in the geom_text() function. We adjust the size and horizontal justification of the labels, and make them bold.\n\n\nannotation2 <- dplyr::filter(fulloutputclean, Ranking<=5)\np <- p +\n  geom_text(aes(label=City),\n            annotation2,\n            hjust=-0.2, nudge_x=0.1, size=6,\n            family = \"IBM Plex Sans\",\n            fontface=\"bold\") \np\n\n\n\nWe can see that highly-ranked cities are all near the coast (i.e. all highlighted in blue because they are east of the meridian 112°), but there is a rather wide range of population sizes among the top 5. For instance, both Shanghai and Suzhou have very high growth potential. Yet, the former has more than 3.5 times the population of the latter. This is because many variables are included in the calculation of scores. For instance, Hangzhou tops the ranking due to its nature as a big tech hub. While government regulation targeting tech firms may hamper its medium- and long-term growth, other factors such as its fiscal position, economic diversity or metropolitan development jointly yield a high growth potential for the city.\nAll in all, as the caption suggests, it seems that location (whose effect is hard to separate from other historical, economic and environmental factors) is more important than current population as a predictor of future economic growth.\n\n\n\n",

            \n\nBuilding the chart\nCoordinates and axes\nWe will work with a single year for now.\nThe base panel consists of simple Cartesian coordinates,\nand depicts life expectancy vs. GDP per capita,\nalthough the x label says the more understandable term “Income”.\n\n\np <- ggplot(filter(gapminder, year == 2007)) +\n  aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp) +\n  ylab(\"Life expectancy\") + xlab(\"Income\")\np\n\n\n\nBoth axes have fixed limits across the whole animation.\nAnother thing to note about the axes is that income is in logarithmic scale with very specific breaks.\nAlso, numbers above 10 thousand are labeled as “10k”.\nThe function scales::label_number comes in handy for this.\nNote that we make some space for annotations on top of the chart\nby setting the maximum limit of the y axis to 95.\n\n\nbreaks <- 500*2^c(0:8)\nklabel <- scales::label_number(suffix=\"k\", scale=1e-3)\nlabels <- c(breaks[1:5], klabel(breaks[-(1:5)]))\n\np <- p + scale_y_continuous(limits=c(10, 95), breaks=seq(10, 90, 10)) +\n  scale_x_log10(limits=range(breaks), breaks=breaks, labels=labels)\np\n\n\n\nTheme\nNote that the theme is very similar to theme_classic, but shows the major grid.\nWe also instruct the theme to remove the legend,\nbecause we will add a custom one later on.\n\n\np <- p + theme_classic() +\n  theme(panel.grid.major=element_line(), legend.position=\"none\")\np\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we could continue to tinker with fonts and other parameters.\nAnnotations\nThe base panel depicts three annotations:\nA big background number indicating the year in the middle.\nFour income levels on the top part, whose breaks seem to be 3k, 8k and 24k.\nThe axes’ units on the top left and bottom right corners.\nFor the background number, we could use annotate with a fixed label,\nbut we will use geom_text instead, even if we overplot it many times,\nso that the year is read from the data.\n\n\np <- p + geom_text(aes(8000, 50, label=year), size=65, color=\"lightgray\")\np\n\n\n\nNext, we add the income levels.\nAdditionally, we will take the liberty of adding vertical lines to clearly demarcate the breaks.\n\n\ntlevel <- c(1300, 5000, 14000, 40000)\nblevel <- c(3000, 8000, 24000)\nilevel <- c(\"INCOME LEVEL 1\", \"LEVEL 2\", \"LEVEL 3\", \"LEVEL 4\")\n\np <- p + geom_vline(xintercept=blevel, color=\"darkgray\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=tlevel, y=95, color=\"darkgray\", vjust=0, size=3, label=ilevel) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=blevel, y=95, color=\"darkgray\", vjust=0, size=5, label=\"◆\")\np\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s add the units to the axes.\n\n\np <- p +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=128000, y=10, hjust=0.95, vjust=1, size=3,\n           label=\"per person (GDP/capita, PPP$ inflation-adjusted\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=500, y=95, hjust=0.5, vjust=-1.5, size=3, angle=90, label=\"years\")\np\n\n\n\nData\nThe chart is a type of scatterplot, with one point per country, and colored by continent.\nThe novelty here is that every dot is scaled up to represent the population size.\nAlso, we will add some transparency to the points.\n\n\np <- p + geom_point(aes(color=continent, size=pop), alpha=0.7)\np\n\n\n\nWe are close, but a couple of adjustments are required.\nLet’s add a black line around the points (see shape 21),\nand adjust the range of the bubbles a bit.\n\n\np <- p + geom_point(aes(size=pop), color=\"#333333\", shape=21) +\n  scale_size_area(max_size=25)\np\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s replicate the same color scale.\nWe need to provide them in the same order as the factor levels:\n\n\nlevels(gapminder$continent)\n\n[1] \"Africa\"   \"Americas\" \"Europe\"   \"Asia\"    \n\nTherefore, from the web, page we obtain:\nAfrica: Blue rgb(0, 213, 233) -> #00d5e9\nAmericas: Green rgb(127, 235, 0) -> #7feb00\nEurope: Yellow rgb(255, 231, 0) -> #ffe700\nAsia: Red rgb(255, 88, 114) -> #ff5872\n\n\nccolors <- c(\"#00d5e9\", \"#7feb00\", \"#ffe700\", \"#ff5872\")\np <- p + scale_color_manual(values=ccolors)\np\n\n\n\nLegend\nThis chart has an interesting legend:\nit takes advantage from the fact that continents are easily recognizable to use a map as a legend.\nLet’s replicate it separately using data from ggplot2::map_data.\n\n\nworld <- map_data(\"world\")\nglimpse(world)\n\nRows: 99,338\nColumns: 6\n$ long      <dbl> -69.89912, -69.89571, -69.94219, -70.00415, -70.06…\n$ lat       <dbl> 12.45200, 12.42300, 12.43853, 12.50049, 12.54697, …\n$ group     <dbl> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,…\n$ order     <int> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,…\n$ region    <chr> \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Aruba\", \"Arub…\n$ subregion <chr> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA…\n\nThis data needs to be tweaked a little bit. We need to:\nFilter out the Antarctica region.\nAdd a new column continent with the help of the countrycode package.\nInclude Oceania into Asia.\nDrop any missing values for continent.\n\n\nworld <- world %>%\n  filter(region != \"Antarctica\") %>%\n  mutate(continent = countrycode::countrycode(\n    sourcevar=region, origin=\"country.name\", destination=\"continent\")) %>%\n  mutate(continent = fct_other(continent, drop=\"Oceania\", other_level=\"Asia\")) %>%\n  drop_na(continent)\n\n\nNow, let’s create the map:\n\n\nlegend <- ggplot(world) +\n  aes(long, lat, group=group, map_id=region, fill=continent) +\n  geom_map(map=world) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=ccolors) +\n  theme_void() + theme(legend.position=\"none\")\nlegend\n\n\n\nFinal result\nSingle year\nIn summary, so far we have\nBuild steps:\nset coordinates and axes, with custom breaks;\nset an appropriate theme and prevent the default legend from appearing;\nadded several annotations, including year, income levels and axis units;\nadded the data points and made several adjustments, including size and color;\ncreated a custom legend based on a simple colored world map.\nThere are several ways we can merge the main plot and the legend.\nIn this case, let’s add it as an inset with the custom annotation function.\nNote that, in contrast to the regular annotation function,\nthis one doesn’t seem to support logarithmic scales very well.\nAs a result, the user needs to provide the transformed values directly.\n\n\np <- p + annotation_custom(\n  ggplotGrob(legend), xmin=log10(16000), ymin=10, ymax=40)\np\n\n\n\nFinally, we can improve this static single-year visualization by adding some context,\ni.e. a title, a subtitle and a caption.\n\n\np + labs(\n  title = \"World Life Expectancy vs. Income in 2007\",\n  subtitle = paste(\n    \"African countries are still lagging behind in terms of general life\",\n    \"expectancy.\\nEuropean and American countries are the healthiest\",\n    \"and richest countries in the world.\"),\n  caption = \"Source: gapminder.org\"\n)\n\n\n\nMultiple years, static\nSo far, we covered the case for a single year.\nHow could we show the evolution, which is the point in this dataset?\nOf course we can define facets to plot all the years.\nIn the following chart,\ngginnards::delete_layers is used to remove the background year;\nwe switch to the whole dataset using the %+% operator;\ndata is faceted in two rows;\naxis labels are slightly rotated to make space for them.\nNote also that we need to manually scale down a bit the range of the bubbles\nto preserve more or less the previous aspect ratio.\n\n\ngginnards::delete_layers(p, match_type=\"GeomText\") %+% gapminder +\n  facet_wrap(\"year\", nrow=2) +\n  scale_size_area(max_size=7) +\n  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=45, vjust=1, hjust=1))\n\n\n\nMultiple years, dynamic\nAnd we can of course animate it!\nWe can easily convert any ggplot2 chart to plotly using plotly::ggplotly,\nwhich produces interactive web-based charts.\nFurthermore, if we set the frame aesthetic, it is automatically detected,\nand an animation is added based on the corresponding variable.\n\n\nplotly::ggplotly(p %+% gapminder + aes(frame=year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
