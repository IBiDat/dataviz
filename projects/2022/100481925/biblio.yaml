    Guidelines for designing information charts often state that the
    presentation should reduce ‗chart junk‘ – visual embellishments that are not
    essential to understanding the data. In contrast, some popular chart
    designers wrap the presented data in detailed and elaborate imagery, raising
    the questions of whether this imagery is really as detrimental to
    understanding as has been proposed, and whether the visual embellishment may
    have other benefits. To investigate these issues, we conducted an experiment
    that compared embellished charts with plain ones, and measured both
    interpretation accuracy and long-term recall. We found that people‘s
    accuracy in describing the embellished charts was no worse than for plain
    charts, and that their recall after a two-to-three-week gap was
    significantly better. Although we are cautious about recommending that all
    charts be produced in this style, our results question some of the premises
    of the minimalist approach to chart design.

    Understanding perception is critical to effective visualization design. With
    its low cost and scalability, crowdsourcing presents an attractive option
    for evaluating the large design space of visualizations; however, it ﬁrst
    requires validation. In this paper, we assess the viability of Amazon’s
    Mechanical Turk as a platform for graphical perception experiments. We
    replicate previous studies of spatial encoding and luminance contrast and
    compare our results. We also conduct new experiments on rectangular area
    perception (as in treemaps or cartograms) and on chart size and gridline
    spacing. Our results demonstrate that crowdsourced perception experiments
    are viable and contribute new insights for visualization design. Lastly, we
    report cost and performance data from our experiments and distill
    recommendations for the design of crowdsourced studies.
